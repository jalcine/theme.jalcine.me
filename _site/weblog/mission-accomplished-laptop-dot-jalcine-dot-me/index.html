    <p>For about a month or so, my laptop was out of working order due to an issue with the DC jack. That&#8217;s the part of the laptop&#8217;s motherboard that takes power from your laptop charger cable to your battery, thus keeping your laptop up and running. <!-- more --> Me thinking of the cheapest and more educational route, I decided to order a new motherboard for it. I own a <a href='http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/K53e'>ASUS K53E-BBR27 laptop</a>, so I ordered a replacement board. I learned quite a few things about laptops and their internals when I replaced the board.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When servicing your own machines for the first time, you will almost end up with &#8220;extra&#8221; screws. I&#8217;ve had this happen to me too many times during the numerous times I&#8217;ve opened up my bad boy and took him around town. I had to upgrade my <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QXLIWI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1'>WLAN card</a> to incorporate bluetooth instead of me having to use a dongle. I also increased my RAM to 8GB thanks to the ever nifty <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YU83YO/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1'>4GB DDR3 RAM card</a>, thus giving my laptop some more thinking space.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The CPU of a computer is a LOT smaller than you&#8217;d expect. I <a href='http://instagram.com/p/Y5PaWCnPg7/'>held it in my hand</a> and I couldn&#8217;t get around how this was the symbol of innovation in our day and age. And they get even smaller yet pack even more power. It&#8217;s really amazing how these things work! I had to remove it from the old board and move it to the new board, for some reason, I assumed the new board to come with a new CPU (whomp whomp).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cleaning the internal components of your laptop make it less noisy (if it makes noise). My laptop rarely makes sound (from places other than the speakers), but I&#8217;ve found that after dusting out the fan and cleaning down the chassis a cleaner and smoother experience. If it doesn&#8217;t have to work hard to cool itself down and move dust out, it&#8217;s a happy camper.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing for certain, this entire process of having to service my laptop by hand has further deepen my want to get more into hobby engineering, especially since it&#8217;s become very &#8220;noob&#8221; friendly in recent days. This will be most likely how I spend a considerable amount of my time in the summer; working on PCBs and understanding how to reprogram them to follow a will.</p>
