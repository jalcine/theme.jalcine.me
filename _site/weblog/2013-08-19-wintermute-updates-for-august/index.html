  <section class="content">
    <p>Well, it&#8217;s August (and has been for a while now). <a href='http://wintermute.jalcine.me'>Wintermute</a> has been chugging along as you can from its <a href='https://waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute'>task-board</a>. I&#8217;m at the point that can make or break Wintermute, it&#8217;s remote procedure calling system. After that, it&#8217;s off to the races by building out the plug-ins needed for the system and working on language bindings for the core aspect of Wintermute.</p>

<h2 id='rpc_zeromq'>RPC: ZeroMQ</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to use <a href='http://zeromq.org'>ZeroMQ</a> because of its protocol transparency; the ability to send the same data to both UNIX sockets and over TCP sockets with no looking back is something I&#8217;d want Wintermute to have. And since support for serial sockets is supported, it&#8217;d make it even more interesting for embedded projects. The only reason behind its &#8220;success&#8221; is its extremely opinionated approach of implementation. Maybe it&#8217;s my lack of complete understanding how sockets work, but having to do something like:</p>

<p><code>c
while (1) {
}
</code> .. just looks stupid to me. I&#8217;m way too used to event-driven programming paradigms and object orientated ones and to do this in my C++ code scared me to no end. Since I&#8217;m using Qt, I figured that not only that there was a C++ binding/wrapper for ZeroMQ, there might be a Qt-level one. There&#8217;s <a href='https://github.com/jonnydee/nzmqt'>two</a> <a href='https://github.com/wttw/zeromqt'>different</a> implementations out there that have a bit of activity behind them. The <code>wttw</code> version has a bit of a licensing issue so that would pose a problem for my project, it being under the GPLv2. The <code>jonnydee</code> fork seems to be good, but attempt after attempt to build it locally failed on my local system. I&#8217;m pointing my finger at <code>qmake</code>, it being not that reliable of a build tool outside of Qt Creator and the likes. I might add it to a PPA of mine in the future.</p>

<h2 id='plugins__all_the_things'>Plug-ins: <code>add_library</code> ALL THE THINGS</h2>

<p>One thing that I noticed is vital is <strong>instant updates</strong>. Before I can explain the importance of this, I&#8217;d have to explain how Wintermute would operate on a machine. At the current build, Wintermute does nothing more besides creating a new <a href='https://github.com/jalcine/wintermute/commit/91703e4a72ac7639dea290713c9be9b2941d1d92#src/Wintermute/Procedure/process_module.hpp'><code>ProcessModule</code></a>, send out one <a href='https://github.com/jalcine/wintermute/commit/79ac9f7a4d35b3189ab2e2cf31c8dc85572c4b75#src/Wintermute/Procedure/heart_beat_call.hpp'><code>HeartBeatCall</code></a> and then hang. Nothing much. The intended goal is to replace that hang with the loading of a plug-in. Wintermute, by itself, can <em>not</em> and <em>will</em> not do anything. I chose this to remove as much dependencies to the core binary as possible so that binaries can be reloaded quickly.</p>
