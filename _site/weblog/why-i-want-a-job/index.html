    <p>At the time of writing, I&#8217;m unemployed. Well, legally speaking, I&#8217;m unemplyed. My <a href='http://linkedin.com/in/jackyalcine'>LinkedIn profile</a> says otherwise, but I&#8217;m slowly squeezing out my savings as we speak. Being twenty and still living with your parents has its ups (and its downs, oh man the downs). But it&#8217;s definitely about time I got my hands wet with something I&#8217;d want to work on.</p>

<p>Before I continue, I have to admit, I had two opporunities to work in some established startups. The only problem was my lack of knowledge of certain paradigms like the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern'>Facade</a> or the reason why Node.js seems to be such a magical god-send.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I&#8217;ve been urged to join a fellowship of sorts, first the <a href='http://www.thielfellowship.org/'>Theil Fellowship</a>, <a href='www.hackerschool.com'>Hacker School</a>, and a few others. I turned them down out of a lack of a big idea idea I was willing to turn into a lucrative business. That&#8217;s not my end-goal, to make money off of people. I want to make some kickass software that&#8217;s inseparable, something that makes you wish that you made it yourself!</p>
<hr />
<p>At the same time, I don&#8217;t have those skills. I don&#8217;t have the necessary knowledege to build stuff at the speed of demigods building kernels for the hell of it. I&#8217;m still a developer-in-training and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;d want training in a bit of a stressful, deadline-paced environment, aka, a workplace.</p>
