    <p>I replied applied for a job as a front-end developer at a pretty amazing digital agency in SoHo, NYC. Meeting with the lead developer, I already loved the potential environment that I could have immersed myself in for days at a time. To complete the first round of the process, a code test was presented.</p>

<p>Pretty (reasonable)<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> (and quite standard) in the tech community for figuring out a developer&#8217;s prowess. About a few days later, I called in to ask about the position. I was turned away because I &#8220;overengineered&#8221;. I was disheartened not because I was turned away per se, but more for to the reason of the such. I didn&#8217;t think that I pushed too hard for the project. It was a simple landing page that collected a few fields from the user. The UX was built from slicing up a PSD but outside of that, it was simple.</p>

<p>When I did hear the alternative (solution)<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>, I noticed something very important. In order for me to continue going down this route as a front-end developer, I have to remember that I don&#8217;t need frameworks let alone management tools to (GSD). The application could have been easily built by hacking up a page using HAML and then writing a quick-n-dirty PHP script to handle the rest.</p>

<p>The means to a solution doesn&#8217;t make it the correct one. Sometimes just getting the shit done easy and cleanly is just the better way to go. <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> don&#8217;t over-do it and build a full-blown SaaS. Just open up TextEdit with a <code>.htm</code> file and call it a day.</p>

<p>My solution was using Silex for rendering a simple language page and handle the work of using Campaign Monitor to collect e-mail addresses. The solution provided was using a fully built HTML page and then having a lighter backend tool to handle the logistics.</p>
