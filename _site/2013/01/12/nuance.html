<div class="post">
<p>Just about the turn of the new year, a few <a href='https://www.launchpad.net/~sii'>friends</a> of mine decided to start a nifty little project. It was planned (and still is) to be the biggest thing in any of our lives.</p>

<p>I was one of the first developers and another lad, <strong>Dante Ashton</strong>, led the product design and implementation. I must admit, we were well over our heads with this project but we did what we could and began to design and program out as much as we could for the application. Back in late 2010, early 2011, we had a server spinning and bent to our will. We had an instance of Bugzilla up and running and doing what we wanted to. We were working hard to attempt to understand what no one else did. We did it in an <strong>open</strong> fashion. We put all of our research in a <strong>centralialized</strong> place.</p>

<p>At CES 2013, Nuance Corporation demonstrated an internal version of a project quite similar to ours. So similar to a point where it has the same exact name. Something like that could be expected, whomever read the book &#8221;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441012035/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358108364&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=neuromancer'>Necromancer</a>&#8221; will not only be connected to the name <strong>Wintermute</strong>. The project was named <a href='https://launchpad.net/wintermute'>Wintermute</a> with its inital sister project <a href='https://launchpad.net/speechcontrol'>SpeechControl</a>. Its sister project was meant to pave a way for speech recognition friendliness on Linux. Yes, <strong>Linux</strong>. I&#8217;ve been a open source advocate for as long as my <code>~/.bash_history</code> can go and I use Ubuntu for server and desktop purposes. I figured that since it&#8217;s a desktop that&#8217;s mallable to no end, why not adapt it even more? This thought and many others in human-computer interfacing of the KDE and Unity desktop to light.</p>

<p>I only ask, Nuance, why didn&#8217;t you ask us before going ahead and using that name in your project? I mean, sure, we&#8217;re just a few teens and adults scattered across the globe trying to build up a far-fetched yet buildable idea. But still, there&#8217;s that common deceny aspect. As a software developer, this is a bit daunting. Having a company whose primary (if not sole) focus is speech recognition, we don&#8217;t really stand a chance (for now, at least). I hope that in coming days, Nuance and the Synthetic Intellect Institute would be able to stand side by side, and not butt heads in attempting to provide innovative tools in the speech recognition space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>P.S: We did have a P.R. release of the project, if curious. <a href='http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/02/wintermute-project-aims-to-bring-artificial-intelligence-to-ubuntu'>Akshat over at OMG!Ubuntu</a> did a nice job of covering us. Hope you enjoy it.</p>
