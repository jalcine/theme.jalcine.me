<div class="post">
<p>I have been working to improve my habits this week and so far, this has been proven productive. I&#8217;ve managed to get a bit of an early morning workout including a full-body stretch so I&#8217;m feeling good. After I <a href='http://any.do'>check off some tasks</a> and get some music going, I can begin working on some personal projects and open-source work. Happy Monday!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to write this post a few times. Clusmy me, I dropped my laptop on the floor while I was in my bed and I finally decided to flip it over and check what was happening inside. I found <a href='http://instagram.com/p/W_uBftnPr0/'>something interesting</a> and fixed it right after.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new habit I&#8217;m working towards is focused heavily on productivity. Using Any.Do and with heavy calendar use, I should be able to accomplish all of the work I have set out for myself. At the end of the week, I&#8217;ll also try to provide a recap and determine what I&#8217;m lacking in. What&#8217;s your weekly mission statement?</p>
