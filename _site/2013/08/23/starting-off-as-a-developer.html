<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve been lacking in, it&#8217;s being a <em>social coder</em>. I&#8217;m a social(-ish) person but I&#8217;m not that social when it comes to code. I&#8217;ve noticed that the best code is written by people who are out there communicating their thoughts, like the jQuery or Vim projects. It makes sense since you&#8217;re <em>using a language</em> to express an idea into a logical (or functional) flow. Communication of an idea is absolutely required then.</p>

<p><a href='https://twitter.com/r00k'>Ben</a> wrote a <a href='http://codeulate.com/2013/08/a-short-guide-to-landing-your-first-rails-job/'>very light post</a> about getting a first job as a Rails developer. Of course, the details of the post can be applied to most other languages and practices, be it Android, iOS, web design or even C++, have you! But it&#8217;d have to be proven for that to be fact. Nonetheless, it did get me thinking; I have this blog and I occasionally post about little things that don&#8217;t really show my current situations with code. I&#8217;ve decided to write a post at least twice a week about my current code projects and things I&#8217;ve learned in code. It not only helps people who are just searching for stuff on the Web, but it serves as a memory anchor for me so I don&#8217;t have to remember details.</p>
