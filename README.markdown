# [Jacky Alcine][1]

This version of my website is called **Lean**. It's a complete rewrite of my
website, still using [Jekyll][] but taking advantage of a lot more custom tags
to make writing posts easier and leveraging my personal [API][1] to make some
pages more interactive.

## Site Map

Below is a rough graph of the pages I plan to lay out for the site. 

  - Simple Landing
  - About (homepage)
    * Press
    * Contact
    * Social Media
  - Work
    * Past Projects
    * Resume
  - Blog
    * {Entries}
    * {LinkLog}
    * Tags
    * Categories
  - Projects
    * `Wintermute`
    * `cmake.vim`
    * `tumblr-dev`
  - GPG information

## Dependencies

  * [isso][] - for commenting support.
    - http://sofish.github.io/pen/ == enhance UI for comments.
    - Implement Ember application to render comments.
    - Vagrant for test environment.
  * [ember][] - for lead generation form, calendar rendering page
    - https://github.com/joinspoton/ember-calendar == calendar
    - https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-cli-medium-editor == edit region.

**Let's make this happen.**
