This repository holds the [Jekyll][] sources for my site hosted at
<https://jacky.wtf>. I keep the sources of it on [Github][] because it's
popular.

## What's On Your Site?

I mean, you could _just_ visit it at <https://jacky.wtf>. But for the lazy, this
is largely a static listing about me. The [things I keep in my bag][1], the
places I like to go to, [how I want to be represented][2] and the like.
