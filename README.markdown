# [Jacky Alcin√©][1]

This repository holds the statically generated version of [my website][1]. I try
to document the changes to the site in [a dedicated page][1] for canonically
corrected changelogs (of sorts).

This version of my website is called [**Acanthaceae**][2]. It's a plant found in
Haiti (but only here - it's common in Latin America).  This version of my site
is meant to be a bit more semantically useful while maintaining the information
I organize on it in older versions.


Below is a rough graph of the pages I plan to lay out for the site. 

  - Simple Landing
  - About (homepage)
    * Press
    * Contact
    * Social Media
  - Work
    * Resume
  - Blog
    * {Entries}
  - Projects
    * `Wintermute`
    * `cmake.vim`
    * `tumblr-dev`
  - GPG information
