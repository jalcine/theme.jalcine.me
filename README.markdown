This repository holds the source code for the [Jekyll][1]-powered website
that's hosted as a front facing representation of Jacky Alcin√©'s online
presence. I've been working on this version of the site since mid-2012, but
been blogging since about 2008. However, for my own sake, I won't attempt to
publish anything older than October 2012.

## Technologies

As aforementioned, [Jekyll][1] is the core blogging tool; with [Compass][2]
and [Sass][3] used for styling the site and the light JavaScript use to make
it fully `l33t`. The [Markdown][] rendered used in this site is [Kramdown][].
For deployments, I use [Mina][] to allow for versioned deployments and rollback
support (nobody's perfect).
