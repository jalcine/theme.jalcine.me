The interesting thing today is that people feel like when it comes to computer
programming, you can be either a *programmer*, *developer* or an *engineer*. I
can understand the easiest way to mix them as the same kind of thing. The
thing that sucks is when any of the following titles are used, they (more or
less) refer to the same thing:

  + web application developer
  + back-end web programmer
  + web service engineer

Of course, this is biased towards the Web. But it could be easily twisted
towards other things:

  + Android engineer, iOS developer, Windows Phone programmer.
  + KDE developer, Windows 8 engineer, OS X programmer.

What I find is that when read to oneself, the *programmer* role seems like the more
like the one that touches 'metal', like it'd have to deal with managing memory or
just fixing things that work directly with a device's operating kernel. At the
moment, I only know that C and C++ that immediately do this due to their
low-level nature[^1]. Mid-level languages are ones built on top of these and
typically help the nature of scripting; those being PHP, Perl and Python[^2].
So the Web services we see today like e-mail, push notifications to mobile
devices from web applications and the like may be written in a scripting
language[^3].

Stepping up to developer implies more of a visual implementation role.
However, these developments don't have to be something *immediately*
visible; a l√° the back-end developer. They provide the fruit that the
front-end developer then turns into a smoothie, salad or juice for a customer
to purchase.


[^1]: This is relative. I work as a web developer so C would be low-level.
However to a kernel developer or a desktop application developer, this might
be mid-level and ASM might be their form of low-level work, or bytecode.
[^2]: If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.
[^3]: But then comes the C-powered blogging platform. Insane, right?
