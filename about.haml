  *Me*: Hey, I'm **Jacky**.
  <br>
  *Reader*: Hey! So who are you?

  *Me*: Well, I'm a freelance web application developer, open  source fanatic 
  and a bit of  a loudmouth. The good kind of loudmouth.  I spend too many 
  hours a day in front of a shell when plans are centered around working 
  or gaming for the hell of it. Don't get to it enough though.

  *Reader*: Ah, that's cool/interesting/different. What are you up to now?
  <br>
  *Me*: Eh, right now, I'm doing consulting work. I've been in the game for
  around five years now; but time is so relative. It's easier to see work done
  as opposed to name dropping.
