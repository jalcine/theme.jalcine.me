  <a href="/">home</a> &raquo; about
</h1>
<p>
  I'm a young adult that likes to use programming languages to write
  software. It doesn't necessarily work 100% of the time, but when it does, it
  results in <a href="https://github.com/jalcine" target="_blank">interesting
    stuff</a>. I'm also an open software advocate and thus try to use open
  source tech as much as I can.
</p>
<h2>code</h2>
<p>
  I work in two environments at the moment, in a <em>desktop</em> one (targeted at
  Linux and Macs) and a <em>web</em> one. Thus, my strongest languages are close to
  what GitHub notices (that being JavaScript and C++ with some Bash). In order
  to get a feel with frameworks and languages, I've <a href="/projects/labs.html">
  worked on some projects</a> that I found interesting (at their time of
  inception).
</p>
<h2>work</h2>
<p>
  With a growing <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> and my "resume" over
  on <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/jackyalcine" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, you'd be able
  to work what I've done.
</p>
<h2>reaching out</h2>
<p>
  I'm always open to a chat <a href="mailto://hello@jalcine.me">via
    e-mail</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/jackyalcine" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
