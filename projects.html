<p>
  Most (if not all) of these projects are out to solve personal problems (or
  ambitions) I've had when it came to programming. My personal favorite and

  thus gets the most love.

  <strong>WINTERMUTE</strong> This project is, in short, my personal attempt to build a parallel
  processing application framework that can operate to the likeness of JARVIS from Iron
  Man. Interested? <a href="{% post_url 2013-07-01-wintermutes-the-name %}">
