<p>
  Most (if not all) of these projects are out to solve personal problems (or
  ambitions) I've had when it came to programming. My personal favorite and
  most loved is <a href="http://wintermute.jalcine.me">Wintermute</a>, and
  thus gets the most love.

<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>
  As with the newest trend nowadays, the source code to this static site is
  available <a href="https://github.com/jalcine/jalcine.me">online on Github</a>.
  I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a
    href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a> and <a
    href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeScript</a> for the HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript.
</p>

<h2>Wintermute</h2>
<p>
   This project is, in short, my personal attempt to build a parallel
  processing application framework that can operate to the likeness of JARVIS from Iron
  Man. Interested? <a href="{% post_url 2013-07-01-wintermutes-the-name %}">
    Read some more</a>. Check out the <a href="http://wintermute.jalcine.me">
    <i class="icon-github-alt"></i> source code</a> if you'd like.

<h2>NoPhucks (Given)</h2>
<p>
  So as a way for me to hack and improve a bit of
  the web technologies I know of, I built <a href="http://nophucks.jalcine.me">nophucks</a>.
  At the moment, it's a self-contained application (meaning all of its actions
  and logic are stored in a few client-side files) using Backbone, jQuery and
  Compass. The app's my way of understanding functional programming via
  JavaScript (a la Underscore), and also gives me the chance to experiment
  with CSS3 + HTML5 features like <code>flex-box</code> and LocalStorage. Take
  a look at the <a href="https://github.com/jalcine/nophucks">source code</a>
  or check it out live <a href="http://nophucks.jalcine.me">on my site</a>.
