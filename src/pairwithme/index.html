    Inspired by <a href="http://www.reiki.org/faq/WhatIsReiki.html">
    David Celis's page</a>, I've decided to add this page to invite
    friends to pair up! I have no real strong preference on the person
    I'd want to pair up since learning comes (for me) in the most unexpected
    way! Here's some things to keep in mind.

    <ul class="w-90 center ma1 mb3">
      <li>
        I'm a big user of <a href="http://www.neovim.org">neovim</a> 
        and most of <a href="http://www.reiki.org/faq/WhatIsReiki.html">
        the mappings</a> I use are laid out online. Study up (
        or provide me yours)!
      </li>
      <li>
        I do try to stick to a <a href="http://www.reiki.org/faq/WhatIsReiki.html">
        TDD</a>-style development flow.
      </li>
      <li>
        I live over in Oakland (on PDT / PST) but can work remotely by
        about +/- 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        By trade, I'm a full-stack web developer working with Python, PHP
        and Go.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is a <em>free</em> service so we won't be working on paid work. Let's
        work together to improve <strong>open</strong> tools and software.
      </li>
    </ul>

    I'm working to invest in the resources shown at <a
      href="http://pairprogramwith.me">Pair Program With Me</a>.
