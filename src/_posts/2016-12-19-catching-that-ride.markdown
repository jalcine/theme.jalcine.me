excerpt:
  After a moment of searching, I’ll be joining the teams at Lyft to make
  ridesharing more friendly and accessible for all.

Today’s my first day working at [Lyft][]! I was fortunate to have a _incredibly_
short job hunt. I’ve begun looking officially for work on November 3rd. Working
with friends to keep morale up and also juggle side work to keep things moving
was a high part of it.

I appreciate *all* of the support I’ve received from friends at [Clef][] in the hunt
as well actors who kept the chin up and the books to my face. Interviewing gave
me a chance to sit in a seat that I nearly forgot about. I have to say that
interviewing candidates _do_ have a lot of authority in their ability to define
their ideal workplaces and that being confident in your skills, background and
ability are absolutely a major :key: to career confidence.

I keep saying that I’d blog more and I _will_ for real in 2017. I’ll be on it
more often since I’ve had a lot of time to read; some mild reviews and “hot
takes” on books I’ve been plowing through will be on here[^1].

## My Objectives At Lyft
I’ll be working on making sure updates and notifications get to you in a fashion
that suits the needs of both the driver and passenger! Keeping people informed
about the real-time status of their ride is vital. That’s the daytime work.

## My Objectives Outside of Lyft
There’s quite a few things that I’ve been working on with people to get moving
and I’m _really_ excited to announce them once they roll out the door. This is
the cliche post about “wait for it” but for real though, **wait for it**!


Definitely a happy note to end the year on :smile:.
