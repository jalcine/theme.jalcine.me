This is a bit of a PSA. Those who track the changes on the site might notice
that I had broken tracking logic on here for quite some time. I finally decided
to sit down and fix that. As of today; I'll be tracking user activity and
traffic on this site. Prior to this, I did that using the information stored in
my access logs from nginx. I never kept them for longer than a month though. Now
I can shrink that size down (to only errors) and target y'all better.

I'll be using this information to determine who's my audience currently and how
I can curtail content on this site to better fit y'all. Right now, I haven't the
faintest idea outside of US-based Chrome users.

Update on this soon come!
