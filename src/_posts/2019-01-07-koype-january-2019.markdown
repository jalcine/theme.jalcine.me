The progress with [Koype][] is moving. It's not as fast as I'd like - [work][]
is keeping me busy during the day so my evenings are spent looking for things to
add as well as plugging through [the backlog][1] of tasks. I'm glad to note that
[Webmention][] support is all in there in a very simple fashion. It's not
asynchronous yet but doing that in Elixir is _very_ simple - hence the punting.
Right now, I'm working on transforming the information from a Webmention into
something Koype can use to present to a post's viewer and the site owner in a
semantically relevant and cached fashion. This means likes from Twitter,
Mastodon or any platform that <https://brid.gy> can support _should_ show up fine
if they render stuff in [Microformats2][].

## Release

I won't have a solid release for Koype for some time. I'm punting until I can
get it in a "simple" deploy unit that someone can just pick up and use.
Something like Go binaries but more battle tested :wink:. That and the pending
release of the [Hub][2] are tied to this release. It's kind of silly but I want
to provide a solid experience for Koype.

## Design

Below is a snapshot of how blog posts will look with Koype:

I like it. _A lot_. Like I'm so excited to make it my primary solution for my
personal site. There's also a Liquid extension for Elixir - that'll make it
simple to port [Jekyll themes][3] to Koype. I have a working list on [the
repository for them][4]; hoping I get the priority ones out soon.

## Contributors

I'm _very_ open to people with experience in design and/or using Elixir to help
out with the project or to even just see if they can get it up and running on
their systems! I had my [first PR review][5] for the project today - super
exciting! Hope to see more in the near future.
