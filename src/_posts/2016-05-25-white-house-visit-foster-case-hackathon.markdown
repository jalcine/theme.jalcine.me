I'm a bit late to the announcement party but I'll be attending the first ever
*White House Foster Case and Technology Hackathon* this week on behalf of Clef!
To be honest, I'm a bit nervous about how this'll go down. This brand of nervousness
is the same kind that I've had when I [started a new job][2] and it's only for
two days so it'll wash over soon. I'll be sure to create a Twitter thread based on 
the tweet that blog post originates from.

Mad people are going to be there from Slack, [StackOverflow][3], Microsoft, you
name it!
