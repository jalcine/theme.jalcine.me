A lot happened this year. Granted, we had 365.25 days to do a lot of stuff.
I can _try_ to go over everything but [ain't nobody got time for that][1]. What
I will say is that everything I set my mind to has happened, despite it taking
a different form from what I expected.

# Music in Living Color

[Afropunk][]'s the first music festival that I've attended in my life. It was
pretty exciting to see so many people I've only really seen via video. I also
ran into some many people that I knew from the Web but never had the honor of
meeting in person.

# Hiking with New Friends

[Pamela][] was in the East Bay and we randomly [got up super early][4] and [took
a hike][3]. It was one of the many awesome experiences I had of meeting people
online and then again in the real world. I forgot why she was in town - I think
it was in relation to a conference. Granted, I couldn't let Pamela marvel in
this by herself:

# Working More
I began getting more serious about working on my freelancing sector of my life.
It's something I've done on-and-off to get my feet wet but it's now become
something I think I'll invest more into in 2018. 2017 led to me working with
products like [ResumeLife][] among others.

My want to experiment more with freelancing is to increase my footing in my
portfolio's breadth. I don't keep a "portfolio" in the classical sense since
most of my work has been more non-presentational and more infrastructural,
although that won't hold for work done at companies like [Clef][].

## Solidifying my Home
Despite a rough (but necessary) split earlier this year, I've managed to make
a space initially guided for two into a place comfortable for many.
Understanding the balance in empty space and non-negative books[^1].

My home wasn't the only thing that got cemented for me. The last Clef cooks really tore me up.

[Clef][] introduced me to the Bay's landscape of tech; something I'll always
thank the family for doing. I also rekindled and built relationships within [Interact][]
and within it, something I'm also looking for:

I built a family in the Bay over the last two years equivalent to that of what I
feel when I land in JFK. That bond now anchors me to the Bay. 2018's the year I
begin to honor that anchor and grow with it.

# Looking Forward
With all of that said and done, I'm aiming to give back more than I received.
Last year, I was given _so much_. It made me feel so empowered but also weird -  
I didn't understand what I did to deserve all of the wealth I received. It
took me some time to understand that it's not about being _worthy_ but
understanding that this is what the world should be more like. A loving, warm
place. We have a _long_ way to go before that's the case - since this question
is still up for debate: [Do Black lives matter?](/faq/blm).
