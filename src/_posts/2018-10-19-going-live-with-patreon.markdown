Today marks the launch of [my Patreon creator page][1]! I've been sitting on the
idea and suggested by a few to do such a thing to help bring awareness to
projects I'm interested in contributing to. I'm turning the dial up a notch by
adding video production and some Q&A sessions in there so I get more
traction as time goes on.

# Initial Projects

I'm going to be working on a few projects around lowering the barrier for people
to begin using their own instances of federated pieces of software. In the same
vein that we'd have a simple way to set up a new blog or store in centralized
entities, we should something like this for federated services. I'll talk more
about this in an upcoming project announcement.

[_Thank you_ for supporting me][2]!
