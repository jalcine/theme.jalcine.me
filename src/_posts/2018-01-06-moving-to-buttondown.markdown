I've used [TinyLetter][] for a while to handle my email newsletter. However,
the UX of the site always felt a bit off for me to use. I ended up writing my
messages in my [local editor][1], having it export HTML, tidy that up a bit then
posting that into TinyLetter for sending it off. That felt like a lot of work
for just sending an email. There's also the case that I didn't want to _have_ to
use a Web-based tool to send and compose my newsletter entries. I don't do that
to write posts for this site - why should I with email?

## Enter Buttondown
Despite my qualms about the editing experience with [TinyLetter][], handling the
editor in [Buttondown][] was _way_ easier than I anticipated. I measure it toward
the editor; it's just a plain old text area region but not _forced_ to look all
ancient.

The notifications and event data that I receive from [Buttondown][] also changed how
I viewed handling email newsletters. The only downside is that all of my older
messages are now unavailable to those who aren't subscribed. I might import them
to be on this site somewhere in the near future.

With this and the features listed on the site, I sat down and moved my mailing
list over. It only took about 6 minutes to move the list of folk over and then
another ten to update the necessary parts around {{ site.url }}.

## Better Experience
The end-goal is to have a **better writing experience**. I think that, so far,
[Buttondown][] is going to make this an excellent experience. [Let me know][3]
if anything looks off.

A mission, if no one else has happened to do it yet, is to create a Vim plugin
that'd allow me to edit and handle my [Buttondown][] mailing list. This would
_greatly_ accelerate my ability to handle the newsletter. Or maybe a [FUSE][]
plugin. We'll see what happens.
