  How highway shutdowns might be not as highly troubling as we once
  thought due to the rise of adaptive, crowd sourced mapping technology.

  Protesting in cities and highways have really taken a turn to a different

This post is a quick and hasty one. Yesterday evening, my partner and a friend
attended the protest that took place at Downtown Oakland. It went as far as the
exit held by Jackson and 5th St and was done by a thousand people. It's been
close to two years since I've participated in a on-foot, road congesting protest
for Black lives and it felt good to be amongst people who shared similar values.

At least I figured so. There was a tremendous amount of nearly-triggering
comments made by allies[^1] that threw me off. It kept me aware that provided
something _really_ went south, they'd most likely swing tail and run. It wasn't
a lot of people, mind you, just a lot of repeated, well, bullshit.

There was an older Black man who took the microphone who said something that I
found to be very direct but it took me a few moments that it wasn't directed for
anyone who wasn't of Oakland and yet still hasn't done any _actual_ work (more
on this later). The gist of the statement was that being here means nothing if you don't
take _anything_ away from it and apply it to the community. Action isn't only 
here, it's a constant flow of work that's been applied to heal and undo the
damage done.

That stuck with me. But that's outside of something that hit me while out on the
880 that Thursday night.

Yes, we managed to choke off a freeway for close to 5 hours.
Yes, we got peoples' attention regarding the most recent events involving the
Oakland Police Department.

**But, did anyone have to go on the 880 at the points we were at in order to go
where they were going?**

I turned to a friend who I was friend and my partner and mentioned this idea.
If Google or other traffic-monitoring tools noticed irrational high rates of
back-up on a particular mode of transportation, wouldn't they _re-route_ people?

This and a few other people came to this idea and eventually ending up letting
the people we've bottlenecked out to go about their lives but we kept the road
blocked. It still got me thinking, what is the point if you can literally go
around? It won't be faster.

The same point as before.
To bring awareness.
To bring community (for those who didn't they existed in this form). 
But also, to be aware.

These cops came up with shields and were swinging batons. Now, two years ago, I
was more willing to throw myself to protect someone. This time around, I had a
lot more than I cared to admit at risk and to be honest, I should have left a
long time ago. See, at that point of the protest, when the cops wanted to get a
pat on the back for beating or attacking a protester, we, people of color (but
particularly Black people), do _not_ throw ourselves into a line of fire that
extends to **everyday life** for us. There were allies who had no problem
antagonizing police officers and then scurrying behind people. *Agitators* will
always exist, and they exist to continue an agenda of the disregard of Black
lives. So little concern and thought given to how _easily_ officers dispatch
Black women out in the streets they _swore_ to protect.

I have to end here because I'm lightly rambling but I want to think a bit more
about how technology, specifically surveillance-laden devices and pieces of
equipment are poised to dismantle any sort of social uprising and what people in
the industry plan to do about it.
