Every year since 2011, I told myself that I was going to try to run _X_ miles, 
read _X_ books or write _Z_ entries on this site. Granted, I didn't accomplish
everything I set myself out to do - which is okay. The one thing I'm excited
that I did do is was record my achievements.

Despite me missing some days of sleep (I did sleep - just didn't properly
record it), the target for about six hours of sleep. And I did a wish-washy job
at it. Getting to sleep with a 2.5 hour commute and a lot of external
commitments is an ongoing challenge that I'm working to solve. When it came to
walking, there's some days that the need to sleep bled into the morning routine[^1].
There's a slight correlation with that on the graphs above.

The takeaway? **Go to sleep**. Stop working late.

## The Importance of Your Morning

The days that I had more sleep _and_ got up earlier led to a lot of things:

  * In the office a bit sooner than expected
  * Read more in transit (with > 1 hr in commuting, I read a lot)
  * Meal prep for lunch (and breakfast) was already available
  * Exercising the morning felt like less of a burden.

At first, I stared at the list above and was trying to understand what about
sleep led to these changes. The fact that I was getting more of the things I
wanted to form into a habit kind of terrified me. It felt so easy. I isolated
it to one thing.

**Vision**. By understanding the potential effects of doing something once, for a
week and then eventually for a month; it seemed way more fathomable for me to do
over time. This is important to note since I grew up in a lifestyle that made you
only focus about today and tomorrow but never passed that. Being afforded the
power to know that I can be okay for a longer period of time helped me build
faith in the process; even motivation - the complementary essential part of this.

My particular vision is to literally be stronger than I am today. Mentally,
physically, emotionally. That felt like something I can aspire to and it's
working. Do you have any tips or thoughts on keeping up morning motivations? Let
me know!
