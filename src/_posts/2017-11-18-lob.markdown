I got a real knack for making super corny weblog posts where I start somewhere
new[^1] [^2]. This title was the best I could do, might be losing the juice!
I'm starting as a senior software engineer over at [Lob][]. Lob focuses on making
the act of delivering letters, checks, postcards and the ilk as simple as sending
a `POST` request. [Check it out][1] and send yourself something. It's _that_
easy.

That's it, to be frank. I'm _really_ excited about this role and the impact that
Lob currently provides and plans on providing. I'll be sure to speak more on the
things that the company's working on - you can get a glimpse at [their blog][2].
