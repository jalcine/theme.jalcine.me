excerpt:
  After an amazing year of growth in my career, I'm excited to announce that
  I'm now looking for opportunities in the <strike>Yay</strike> Bay Area.

It's been a year since I've come to the Bay to [work at Clef][1] and I have to
say, I really enjoyed my time there! I learned a lot about making user security
more intimate and intuitive.

Working at Clef revitalized the life of a high paced startup development
environment that I haven't experienced not too long ago. That involves the
culmination of having to pick up new infrastructure and work within
environments designed to be erected for stability. I got to use Docker
in a production environment which, personally, made me ditch Vagrant
for the most part.

I got to learn a lot of things outside of work as well. I hear that's a requirement
for a healthy work/life balance :wink:! I got to learn about the Black Panthers
(who I legit thought started in Harlem[^1]), the [ABC][], and many other sectors
of people and movements by people of the neighboring cities of Oakland. It's
definitely a culture  and climate shift coming from Brooklyn; a city whose
tendencies haven't worn off yet. It's provoked me to invest in myself in a new 
way: buying up loads of literature. My apartment is swelling with Black focused,
liberation centered and equality rearing literature and I don't know if I'll
have the time to read it all! I have a lot of people to thank for even
suggesting books (that probably didn't know that they did). That's in another
post.
