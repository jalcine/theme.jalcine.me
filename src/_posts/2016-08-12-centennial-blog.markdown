I was finishing up a morning entry[^1] and about to begin packing my bag for the
day. Before I left, I randomly ran this command in my terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
$ find src/_posts/ -type f -ls | wc -l
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, the astute reader would ask, "why not just use `ls`" directly? I have
no reasoning outside of me just experimenting with different tools to get better
at using the shell over overloaded GUI tools.

That sentiment - understanding the NLUI[^2] over re-learning different GUIs
everywhere I go (macOS / OS X, Linux, CentOS) - feels _extremely_ more valuable,
intuitive and more transitive than attempting to understand the GUI and its
operation. 

It's a random sentiment, but yes, 100 blog posts and counting. Maybe I'll reach
a thousand one of these days if social media doesn't end up replacing blogs.

Who knows?
