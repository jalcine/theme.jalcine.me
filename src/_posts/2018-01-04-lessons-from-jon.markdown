I first met Jonathon a while ago. And when I say a while ago, it was _some_
time (at least in current tech time cycles). I remember when I (failed to)
tried to get with [Blavity][] at the ground floor. It was a video chat I
had squirreled away in one of the offices at Shutterstock with [Morgan][1]
about potential opportunities. Granted now, I also wonder and reflect on
what _could_ have been.

We obviously both grew in very beautiful lanes, so no need to reflect anymore.
If you don't know, I'm a fierce advocate for the growth and expansion of
Blavity. Still got the OG shirts and hoodies in the back, haha!

Jonathon wrote a piece about the things [he's learned from 2017 on Blavity][2].
If you haven't, you should catch up on his [2015][3] and [2016][4] posts as
well. Let's walk through some of the highlights of this post.

# Fake Friends

> **Access is earned**. It can be rescinded and/or denied as necessary.
> &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

This is something that rings home. A lot of people pop out of the wood work when
your name appears in the top results in Google's search results. Or if you
happen to trend in an area. Or even if your name's mentioned ample times in an
environment[^1]. You know my name? Cool. You _might_ [know who I am][5]. But if
I ain't confirm that we're friends and not just acquaintances, then chill with
the name dropping.

> Community is not about your convenience. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Son. Hold on. Let us _examine_ the opening sentence here.

_2017 saw a rise in people obfuscating the word *community* so much that it
started to sound like a synonym for a *membership* site you pay into instead of
a vibrant entity that is the sum total of its inputs, both seen and unseen._

If this isn't a word, then :shit: you might as well skip out on the rest of this
entry.

> Waiting until you clear your first million before you give isn’t thoughtful.
> &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Reading this made me think of my immediate and then extended family. Jonathon
and I share the first-gen Caribbean descent aspect. I'm not sure about the
academic routes of his life (with regards to first accolades in academia) but
I know that my family _needed_ someone to pull in :money_with_wings: after
things got more difficult. That instilled in the behavior of sharing whatever
_whenever_. Whenever I negotiate pay or open a [new contracting engagement][6],
I almost always think about how the money can help those closest to me. It tends
to find a way to them somehow.

> Recognizing someone as valuable and treating them as valuable should never
> be conflated. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Another self-explanatory and concise one.

# Love, Relationships and Courtship

> Love without specific action is ambiguity that feels nice. The price for that
> is too high. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

This is something to note as well. It's become a bit of a thing (if not already)
to date or engage in relationships with no true direction. This might be the
analytical part of myself but direction and a working compass are things I like
to bring into relationships (of any size). I'm all for knowing what the point of
things are - where your head's at and what you'd like to go.

Of course, if you need time to figure that out; it's cool. The question now is
if I'm obliged to wait for something that's intrinsically related to you. That
said, here are some other tweets that reached out to me:

> Do not keep score. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Do not compare yourself to others who are NOT you. I can't repeat this enough.
I said something about this year last year :wink::

# Career; Work + Life Balance

> Being busy is the wrong measuring stick for importance. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

I am _notorious_ for filling my calendar up with everything I'm doing, need
a reminder on. I sync my TODOs from [orgmode][7] to my personal Google calendar
which can block me off from things at work (and visa versa). It's a _lot_.
Jonathon continues on to say:

> You control your time, and you use that brush in strokes and dabs and 
> sprinkles so you get the most out of what you need to. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

That's how I've "rationalized" my over-zealously filled calendar - by offloading
what I'm doing (or more so, _when_); I can just focus on what I'm doing now. And
it works amazingly well for me. I'm also the kind of person who needs detail as
to where I'm going and why so this might play into it. If we're meeting up, it's
in my calendar - no matter how informal it may be.

This "over-planning" doesn't equivocate to being busy, though. It's an aspect of
wanting to knowing when I have the time to unwind whilst still producing as much
impact as I can in the lives of others.

> The issue is that a number makes it feel better when you are toiling in
> obscurity, and gives us something to hit. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

This is the sad part of the age we live in. We're focused on ARR, MAU, DAU, CAC,
SLoC, test coverage, deals closed, hiring caps, number of degrees, iPhone `n`,
the number of miles we ran, how many bodies people "catch", etc, that we forget
to focus on _the quality_ of things and not the quantity. A side effect of
capitalism (or just plain ol', unchecked greed).

> Stop expecting grace from people who define themselves by a meritocracy
> you are not a part of. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

If you know me off-line, you know that this is something I _preach_. These doors
and pillars weren't built for us but they were damn sure built _by us_. It's
anti-FUBUism to think that if we dress the same way, eat the same or speak the
same; that we'd gain some kind of immunity to the bullshit that plagues the DNA
of establishment that _still_ thinks we're 3/5th of a person.

I should just say that everything in the "Career & the Grind (You Wasn't There)"
section of that post is golden and my people need to take notes and apply them.

# Emotional Intelligence

> I’m not a tough guy, but I was raised to match the energy presented, and after
> all other options are exhausted, to use whatever means necessary to ensure my
> own safety and that of anyone in the vicinity. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Something I grew up holding tight but never really fully harnessing until a few
years ago.

> Compassion and empathy are not the same thing. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

I wish Jonathon expanded on this a bit more but he did give an excellent analogy
that carried the message loudly.

> [D]o not deprive us of a whole you by leaving half of you somewhere where no one
> can find you. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

In a nutshell. This is more than bringing your whole self to the places and
relationships you enter. This is about being honest _to yourself_ about the
things that _you know_ happened to you, that _you've_ experienced and how they
can reverberate back into those who care about you and want to get closer to you.

# Getting Uncomfortable (and Branching Outside of Your Domain)

> You don’t have to invent “haters.” People will find their way to become one
> all by themselves. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

A word. No, a sentence. Because this is something that can live in a whole post
in itself. When you're doing something for yourself and your own growth, those
who don't want to tend to their own garden _will snarl_.

> Is Confessions really better than 8701?

C'mon son. Confessions was a confirmed banger. Don't do this, lol. That joke
aside, the set of questions posed above that are some I'd want y'all to take
away with and see how you can craft some of your own as you begin your descent
(or ascension!) into 2018.

Jonathon, thank you for this post.
