For those of you who've been [tuning in][1], you'll know what tomorrow holds!
I'll be in Portland today until Wednesday for the [IndieWeb Summit][2] and
exploring the city a bit. I'm hoping to learn a lot and meet more of the people
I've known from over the Web in person.

I'll be live-blogging the event from my [Mastodon account][3] and aim to make
recap posts of what I've captured from each day. If you happen to be in the
area, please feel free to [reach out][4] so we can stay in touch.

I'm super excited to see what happens!
