  Doing some homework on my ancestory, heritage and culture made me realize it
  was due time to update my background on LinkedIn. Would you mind connecting
  with me?

I've decided to classify myself as a **Black Afro-Haitian** individual as 
opposed to being an African American. I initially challenged this idea early
2014 when I wanted to really understand what my background was but not
necessarily who I am; more about the people that came before and right up my
moment of existence. My parents and grandparents were all born in Haiti, with
the exception of my mother's mother being born in the Dominican Republic[^1].
All of whom having a overwhelming amount of African and Native Hispaniola 
ancestry, dating back to colonial dates of Hispaniola (and prior)[^2].

The whole intent behind this self-identification is two-fold: to help me
_remember who brought me here_ and where I feel _I should go to help_ advance things
in the future for my people. The latter is more personal than I'd rather care to
blog about but the former is something more important than most lead on. I think
that for me, not having a sense of belonging to a place made me a bit of a
unwilling nomad, travelling with some sort of an idea of where I should end up.
Knowing and being able to reach out to people who I can not only identity with
but also channel a shared heritage is *powerful*[^3]. Of course, it's not so
cut-and-dry, some people prefer you to be a patriot to the cause - claiming your
heritage via your name, clothing, food, ideologies, etc. This is something I'm
still working on understanding where the line is drawn due to the effects of
globalization and how cultures became the new commodity[^4].

Growing up, I knew things about Haiti via my parents and the photos they showed
me. I heard of their hometowns and studied photos of extended family I've only
met over video camera. I wanted to be a part of this but I was also exposed to
other backgrounds, be it Trinidadian, Guyanese or other countries local to the
Caribbean[^5]. This knowledge left a tether that I feel I cannot find in other
places. It might be the unique nature of sub-sectors of Brooklyn (or New York,
in general) that exposed this facet of Afro-(Latinx,Caribbean) culture that I
feel is important to acknowledge.

This isn't a division call. This is more for my own rationalization on how to
draw my family tree. If anything, this post is more for me to keep my journey
public and in line so I can encourage others who can draw paths back to do so,
to make the map for others more clear. This is one disadvantage or advantage[^6]
that enslaved Africans had when it came to ancestry. There's definitely the oral
reciting that happened but with people who wanted to alienate those facets of
their life, it became extremely difficult for the next generation to determine
their roads home. I'm fortunate enough to be able to trace my family back at
least five generations and I'd be taking advantage of this opportunity to see
what else I can learn about my heritage and role in the world.

[^1]: According to my mom. I haven't seen any documents, but I trust her.
[^2]: I mention colonization by France and Spain since (AFAIK), West African people weren't introduced until then.
[^3]: One of the many reasons why adequate history and present education regarding the African American presence here and the history of prominent African nations aren't core to public education, especially in regions where the student population tends to be predominantly Black.
[^4]: See South Korea's heavy exporting of food, music and media and the hyper consumption of it over here in the States. Also see Urban Outfitter's constant appropriation and fashion runaways claiming Black hair care and fashion as "edgy"
[^5]: I don't like this name nor am I confident that this is the accurate term of this part of the world.
[^6]: Depends how you look at it.
