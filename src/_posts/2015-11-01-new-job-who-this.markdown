  Man, oh man, do I have some news for you! I wasn’t ready for this announcement
  myself to be honest, but once I dropped it, woooooo.

---

I have two announcements that I'm more than honored to share with y’all.
The first one is that I'm moving to California! Leaving my ever-loved home of
Brooklyn, NY to land in the East Bay. I'm feeling a mixture of excitement, fear
and joy all the same time. The move is one I've wanted to make for a _long time_
but didn't have the momentary availability or requirement to do so. That leads
me to my second announcement! As of today, I'll be the 8th employee over
at [Clef][]. If, somehow, you don't know what they[^1] do, [start here][1]
:grinning:.

If you feel like you know me, you'd know that this is one hell of a change for
me. I'm a Brooklyn guy through and through but that was one of the many reasons
that led to my choice in moving out to California. I've been asked so many
questions about the process:

  * Where are you going to live?
  * How will you adjust? You can't even drive or ride a bike!
  * WHAT ABOUT BAE?[^2]
  * What’s the stack?
  * How do they make that thingy work with the line thingy?!

I admit, that last question was one I asked during the interview :confused:.

All of these have been resolved and figured out for the most part. I've even
decided to work on a photo blog kind of thing using [Flickr as the
repository][2] and perhaps this blog to expand on each photo and my experience
there. We'll see how things play out.

[^1]: Well, now **we**! :grin:
[^2]: The number of times I've been asked this (and how it's almost always the second question)...
