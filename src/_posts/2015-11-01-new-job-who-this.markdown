  Man, oh man, do I have some news for you! I wasn’t ready for this announcement
  myself to be honest, but once I dropped it, woooooo.

---

I have two announcements that I'm more than honored to share with y’all.
The first one is that **I'm moving to California**! I’m leaving my ever-loved home of
Brooklyn, New York :statue_of_liberty: to land in the East Bay :house:. I'm feeling
a mixture of excitement, fear and joy all at the same time. The move is one I've
wanted to make for a _long time_ but didn't have the momentary availability or
requirement to do so. That leads me to my second announcement!
**I’m the newest human over at [Clef][]!** If somehow you don't know what
they[^1] do, [start here][1] :grinning: but come back here!

If you feel like you know me, you'd know that this is one hell of a change for
me. I'm a Brooklyn guy through and through; being one of the _many reasons_
that led to my choice to move out to California. I've been asked so many
questions about the process:

  * Where are you going to live, Jacky!?
  * How will you adjust? You can't even _drive a car or ride a bike_!
  * **WHAT ABOUT BAE?[^2]**
  * What’s the stack over at Clef?
  * How do they make that thingy work with the line thingy on my phone?!
  * DIRI AVEC LUMBEE? Do they have that?!

Each of these have been resolved and figured out for the most part. I've even
decided to work on a photo blog kind of thing using [Flickr as the
repository][2] and perhaps this blog to expand on each photo and my experience
there. We'll see how things play out.

## FOME (Fear of Missing Everyone)

A play on **[FOMO][3]**, I’ve been thinking about how much I’m going to miss
Brooklyn and the people in it in this new chapter of life. Sure, I could visit
but I’d be coming back to the city as _a visitor_, not a resident anymore.
The people who built the person who’s bringing this message to you are still 
going to be there. Initially when I took this offer, high levels of guilt became
to swell in me. It was like a sense of incompleteness and confusion.
It took a while to reason out the emotions here but it was just me being
**afraid** of being away from a place I knew for sure to be safe. I spoke to my parents
about this and there’s one thing that they wanted me to be over anything
(outside of remaining in constant contact):

[{% asset "{{ 'IMG_20150926_180029.jpg' }}" alt="Be happy" width="auto" height="auto" class="present" %}][4]

They wanted me to **be happy**. My dad wanted me to be a doctor :needle:, my mom
to stop being smart :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:[^3]. Neither got what they
wanted. The happiness they wanted me to have, I did get, though. Shoot, I wanted
to be an astronaut when I was younger but I got into computers that stayed
on the ground instead. Now, I’m doing something I really didn’t think I was
ready to until I just hit “okay”. **I’m leaving the nest**. I’ll be in the
company of really, really, really great people. I’m more than confident I’ll
run into even more as I grow. It’s just a little scary building up on my own.

But I won’t be **alone**.

## Shifting Gears on Visibility

If you follow me on Twitter, you know that [I tweet **a lot**][5] :mega:. I tweet so
much that instead of me using the phrase “I use Twitter a lot”, I say “I tweet a
lot”. If that doesn’t mean much, I’m always insisting that my siblings say that
they’re “searching the Web” instead of using Google as a verb. I need to listen
to my own advice :laughing:. What I’ll plan on doing on the few months of my journey
is documenting it more. So listen; I’ll be chatting.

[^1]: Well, now **we**! :grin:
[^2]: The number of times I've been asked this (and how it's almost always the second question)...
[^3]: The _bad_ kind of smart. Like someone always with a retort. Runs in the family, come to think of :laughing:
