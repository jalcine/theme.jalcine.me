I keep talking about [IndieWeb][]. Today, I attended the [IndieWeb Summit of
2018][1] and left feeling super enamored to not continue working on my site and
building tools for others to experiment with, but also to figure out how to
better market and push for the migration of those on [silos][2] to transition
off and into safer and more reliable environments. There was also a huge amount
of other topics and things demonstrated today that really inspired me to keep
pushing and building to bring the nature of the IndieWeb _back_ to the people
who need it the most and those who just enjoy it.

## The Recap

I took to [Mastodon][] on [Are0h's instance][3] to live-toot my experience[^1].
I also syndicated it to Twitter for those interested[^2].

## Projects

A lot of interesting projects were launched over the last few days. Despite the
event not having a heavy overarching theme, the most popular thing that came up
was that of the [IndieWeb reader][4].

### Indie Readers

For those unfamiliar with the concept, here's the except from the IndieWeb
wiki describing it:

> A reader (AKA _indie reader_ or _social reader_) in the context of 
> the IndieWeb is the portion/feature integrated into an IndieWeb site
> that provides a way to read content from other IndieWeb sites, 
> possibly including posts from the current site, and respond (like,
> comment, repost, etc) inline in the reading [interface] itself.

The best example of this I could find was on [Amber Case's site][5] with
a screenshot below and more information in a [longer blog post][6] demonstrating
their use of said platform.

### IndiePaper

[cleverdevil][] hacked together a solution that allows you to save articles to
be read later using [Micropub][] and [Microsub][] systems. There's a more
in-depth explanation on the [site itself][7] so try it out if you have a chance.

### IndieBookClub

As someone with over 1,300 books in my "to-read" and over a hundred read books
in the last few years on my Goodreads list, moving this to a IndieWeb-friendly
place is a priority for me. [Gregor][] has introduced [IndieBookClub][8] for the
purpose of posting updates to your MicroPub-compatible site about what you've
read thus far! Learn more by checking out [his blog post announcing it][9].

### Tweaks to `micro.blog`

For those unfamiliar, [micro.blog][] is a platform that evolved to support of
IndieWeb-esque features for posting and syndication around one's content. Manton
announced an array of new features, namely that profiles can be IndieAuth
_providers_, allowing people to sign in using the hosted domain names (like
`jacky.micro.blog`) to other sites that request MicroPub-compatible site
addresses.

## So Much More Happened!

I mentioned things that were _super_ notable to me (and that I was able to grab
more blurb-y info for y'all) but thanks to everything being recorded and
captured (notes _and_ videos), you can check it all out on the [Tuesday
Schedule][10]. Some sessions I attended were the ones around [finding a list of
libraries we can use to build IndieWeb-friendly tooling][11] as well as getting
some deeper [understanding and extrapolation around what Vouch could be used
for][12]. If you have some feedback and/or updates for this post, please send me
a WebMention or even reply to this so people can discover it below!
