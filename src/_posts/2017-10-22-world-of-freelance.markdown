It's been about a month since [I've part ways with Lyft][1] and begun working on
a few projects. The biggest project I'm working on is [twch.at][5]. It's
something I've been brewing on for some time now and I'm glad that I have more
time to work on it now. However, working on passion projects pre-profit doesn't
cover food bills.

# Tools I'm Using

Since getting deeper with freelancing, I've kicked up my subscriptions with
services like [RescueTime][2] and [Toggl][3]. However, I've decided to drop
Toggl due to its desktop application being extremely noisy when I'm plugged in
and it being overall being a bit of a shelled out service. I took a lot at
[Bonsai's list of freelancing tools][4] and ended up looking into using
[Harvest][4] for time tracking, invoices and the whole nine. The biggest thing
about these services is my ability to export data from them. That feature gives
me the greatest flexibility if I ever need to switch and a level of trust when
it comes to data exposure.

RescueTime is probably one of the _best_ services I've used for recording and
understanding my daily habits. The level of detail it gets really helps me
scruntize how I spend time and how I can set up tooling to make sure I spend my
time wisely. [Try it for a while on me][2] and see it for yourself. The biggest
thing about it is that I can set alerts around how much time I spend working to
make sure I hit my requirements for sustainability. Initially, I did this check
weekly but quickly realized that it wasn't soon enough for me to be able to make
up for lost time.

# Networking

I'm really fortunate to have a strong following on places like [Twitter][6] to
help me find new leads for contracting work. However, it's always tricky
balancing load with capability. This is why I've decided to open up a leads
section in my [newsletter][7] to help people who are subscribed to find more
work. It's how I get my start, it's only right to do the same.
