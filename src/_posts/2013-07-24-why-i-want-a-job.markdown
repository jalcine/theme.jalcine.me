  I hear that you have a position open.

At the time of writing, I'm unemployed. My [LinkedIn][] profile
says otherwise, but I'm slowly squeezing out my savings as we speak. 
Being twenty and still living with your parents has its ups 
(and its downs, oh man the downs). But it's definitely about time 
I got my hands wet with something I'd want to work on.

Before I continue, I have to admit, I had two opportunities to work in some
established startups. The only problem was my lack of knowledge of certain
paradigms like the [Facade][] or the reason why Node seems to be such a magical god send.

Nowadays, I've been urged to join a fellowship of sorts, first the [Theil
Fellowship][], [Hacker School][], and a few others. I turned them down out of
a lack of a big idea idea I was willing to turn into a lucrative business.
That's not my end goal, to make money off of people. I want to make some
software that's inseparable, something that makes you wish that you made it
yourself!

At the same time, I don't have those skills. I don't have the necessary
knowledge to build stuff at the speed of demigods building kernels for the
hell of it. I'm still a developer in training and that's why I'd want training
in a bit of a stressful, deadline paced environment, aka, a workplace.
