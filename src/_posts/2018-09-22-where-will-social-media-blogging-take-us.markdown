title: "Where Will the Current State of Blogging and Social Media Take Us?"
excerpt: |
  I'm not an veteran blogger but I do wonder what blogging or just sharing our
  thoughts on the Internet will look like in the next decade or so.

So I'm typing this from within [my favorite text editor of choice][1] using this
[markup language that was made(?) by Daring Fireball over ten years ago][2]. And
I used to be satisfied with this. But it's not enough for me anymore. See, the
whole "tech" appeal of writing my blog from the console and what not probably
made sense if you didn't blog _hyper_-frequently, like more than 3 times a day.
Nowadays, I catch myself doing it probably once or twice an hour.

## Blogging On the Hour?
I used to have a little memo on [the blog index page][3] explaining where the
word "blog" came from and a bit as to why I use _weblog_ instead of _blog_ on
here. But now with things like [Mastodon][4], I'm starting to wonder if this
actually falls in line with the whole testament I made when I wanted 
to [take things in-house][5] nor with my [commitment to the IndieWeb][6].
Everything I write and post _should_ be coming from me. Or at least, the
digital _authoritative_ representation of me. I can prove that I own (or
at least, I'm _leasing_) my domain name at `jacky.wtf`. I can try to prove
that I produced content on platforms like Twitter or Instagram but if
things aren't shown as there were intended (say algorithmically
repositioning), then what control do I have out of the relinquishing of
content to a bunch of media distribution companies?

Granted, I take pride in my site. It's been chugging along for about 6 years
now under different domain names. But I want to make things more closer to home.
I shouldn't have to give you like 13 different URLs to have you find a _kind_ of
content that I want to share, produce or reference to. I should be able to say
something like the following:

> Hey. I'm Jacky! My site's at jacky.wtf. You can find info about what I'm doing
> right now, some photos I've taken and even my last random notes I've taken
> down.

Something like this would translate into the following when using [silos][7]
(closed-source, closed-network platforms):

> Hey. I'm Jacky! I have a site at jacky.wtf, but I put all of my photos and
> videos on Instagram and I stay using Twitter to keep people in the loop.

Using these isolated services make it hard for us to express ourselves in the
days of MySpace (for my generation) or even further back. It _has_ created
ingenuity in terms of content production within these constraints but the act
of being forced in a box for the sake of revenue reeks of that post-industrial
content creation farms. There's an adage; if you're not _paying_ for the
service, you _are_ the product.

## Finding Community

The most immediate thing and one of my personal anchorages to the silo
rings (Twitter, Facebook et al) is that I've built relationships with
people and content on there. The act of following local people and then
having them carry content from like people into my streams led to
a bidirectional growth. A growth for my incoming read of content from
everyone and their audience and I built a following on that same notion
that said content would be up kept.

Noting that, it isn't terribly different from how one would attempt to
find people to befriend offline[^1]. Going to studios or venues of things
that you're interested in doing (improv, baking, archery or just playing
video games and drinking cider in an arcade) were ways to find friends.
You also could have made them in classes you had in school, sermons during
theological places and so on. I don't know what existed before hashtags
outside of [planets][8] but those two concepts were ways to find people
and content on things you were interested in. Reddit's plumbing is _built_
around this notion. Twitter is compartmentalized around this notion too.
Even platforms built on the notion of _decentralization_ and _federation_
uses a centralizing tactic of federating hashtag content to **build
community**. It's a bit inevitable.

## Building a Tower
There's this concept in engineering called the [single point of failure][7]; the
notion that by centralizing a lot of critical processes, you increase the chance
of failure (catastrophic or not) to occur. One could say that by using
platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or the like. Currently, my
"identity" is still splintered across multiple places/services on the Web.
To fulfill what I'm reaching at, I'd have to have `jacky.wtf` be _the
place_ where my images are posted from, my blog posts are published at, my
check-ins are stored and so forth. There is a concern with security and
it's actually relatively reasonable.

To plug the [IndieWeb][] once more, there's a notion of doing all of this
kind of stuff. Self hosting (or owning on a shared system) all of your
content, controlling who gets to see what and doing it in a way where
people can craft what they want and people use solutions that they build
_for_ community.

This post went from a bit of a reflective (nostalgic?) trip into my experience
on the Internet for the last 15 years to me potentially wanting and wondering
what's next. What's actually _next_ for the social facets of the Internet that
aren't driven largely by corporate interest?

## Looking at the Anvil
This (oddly) has me returning to my terminal writing this post. It took me
some time to write this post but the idea of it has been lurking since
June. It's possibly me slowly but surely being to write _off_ Jekyll and
beginning to move into either a home-grown solution or using something
else. I don't know yet. I don't think one _usually_ does; especially when
it comes to moving. You don't _know_ what kind of memories you end up
actually making when you move in somewhere.

I'm interested in finding out, though. Thanks for figuring this out with
me. Let me know your thoughts.
