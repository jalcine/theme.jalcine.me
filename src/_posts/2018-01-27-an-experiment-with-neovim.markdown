  Using Vim for almost everything makes me feel decently versed in writing
  about it.

Some time ago, one of my more [popular posts about Neovim][1] outlined my
excitement and glee about [Neovim][] went around the Web. It's still one of my
most popular posts to this day of writing. Because of my personal understanding
and heavy use of the application; I want to see if I can rebuild how I use it
from scratch from a behavior-orientated approach vs tacking on what I need when
I need it.

# The Goal
I'm working on rebuilding my entire set of configuration setups and tweaks for
Neovim to make it more tailored to its particular use case. I'll be starting
this on February 1st, 2018 and continue for the duration of the month[^1] of the
such. I'm aiming to work on the following things:

  * Configuration retrieval and synchronization
  * Mappings
  * Initial plugins
  * Infra-plugin support
  * Case Study: Prose
  * Case Study: Outlining
  * Case Study: Red/Green Refactoring
  * Case Study: VCS Management

The mission is to work on each of these points as the month progresses and use
it to replace the years-old setup and cruddy repository I currently have. Once
I'm done, I aim to mirror it on the [GitHub][2] repository. These are the things
I'd like to be able to use Vim for.

Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on things I should use Vim for? Do you
use Vim a lot and want to see if I can fold some common mannerisms into this
project? Let me know!
