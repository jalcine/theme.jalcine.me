  Attending the last HWC SF meetup of the year!

---

This Wednesday is another chance to pull up to the [IndieWeb][] meetup held in
San Francisco! There's a bunch of them happening around the world - even
a virtual one. Be sure to check it out if you're in the area.

Bring your personal projects, website code or anything you'd want to move into
or work on that's [IndieWeb][]-adjacent. Hope to see you there!
