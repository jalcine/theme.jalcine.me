  Probably my _first_ birthday-related post ever?
---

So in a few hours, I'll be about twenty-fine, er, -five years old. I also 
wondered; how come we count birthdays from the time one's crown touches
outside air? Why not when we get our first heartbeat? I don't know. I'm
truthfully writing this to say that if you're cool with me and wanted to
do something nice in honor of my birthday[^1], I want you to do one of the
following things:

# Donate / Divest

I'd rather you sent money to organizations that do _incredibly_ work versus
sending me something that may or may not contribute to the crappy world we
live in[^2]. If you want to align a bit with ones I personally align with and/or
donate to, check the list below!

### Organizations

 * [InTech Camp for Girls][1]: This is run by a [good friend, Khalia][1]. I'm 
   glad I caught her in the middle of this journey and the work she does
   with the youth is _beyond_ important.
 * [Cat Brooks for Oakland][3]: This woman has done _so_ much for Oakland.
   I doubt she'd remember but during a protest, in my failed attempts to get
   people safely off a highway; she did so with ease and skill. I felt safe 
   with her and I trust her to bring Oakland to a better era - especially
   with the state of affairs it's in.
 * [TechActivist.Org][4]: Another heavy-hitting group making moves not only
   in the Bay but throughout the world on a grassroots level.
 * [Human Utility Project][5]: This one hits _home_ for me. Water is
   a right. It's required to _live_. Click the link and help me raise
   $1,000 to help those who need to keep their utilities _on_.
 * [GoodForPoc][7]: Is this technically a self-plug :laughing:? We _do_
   have some work in the pipelines - rough when we all got day jobs.
   Even just following us helps!
 * [The Free Black Women's Library][8]: Need I say more?

[^1]: It's really sweet if you even have the thought of doing _something_.
[^2]: I don't say this to say that I won't appreciate it.
