As you might know from prior posts [^1][^2], the [IndieWeb][1] has been on my
mind a lot. I'm making another step into my commitment and eagerness to
contribute by attending the summit that's happening in Portland, Oregon this
year. The [schedule][2]'s online and prepped to go :boom:.

If you have any thoughts, questions or just general inquires about the IndieWeb
or what kind of topics will be discussed, let me know below and I'll
live-comment on the event when it happens with your :bulb: thoughts in mind.
