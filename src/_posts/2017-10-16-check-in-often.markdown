excerpt: |
  Getting off the phone with a friends of decades made me realize that I don't
  lean back often enough.

I just got off the phone with someone who's seen me in my most honest state. He
watched me dream my biggest dreams. He knew about my ambitions into computer
science way before I even understood what I was working on. We competed in
junior high school to be the smartest[^1] one there. I almost broke into tears
just hearing his voice. It's been so long, too long.

That short eight minute call made me realize that I don't really do a good job
about keeping ties that are precious to me. Or if I even value them as much as
I claim to. Ending the call, I made a commitment to call more often and mention 
when I'm in the area (he's not too far!) during my trips. I really just couldn't
believe the updates in his life that he was giving me. I couldn't fathom it
because I couldn't imagine it for myself. But after a few moments on the call, 
it made absolute sense the routes he took in life. I really miss him. I can't 
wait to see him soon.

Hit up those old friends. **Maintain your relationships**. And not just the new
ones.

[^1]: This ended in a stalemate. I ended up going to a specialized high school
      but he was the valedictorian of our graduating class.
