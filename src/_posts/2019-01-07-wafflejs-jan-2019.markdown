  2019.

This Wednesday is your chance to pull up to [WaffleJS][] - a super chill monthly
meetup about things JavaScript (or not - it's a safe and open space to talk
about tech and things related to it). I'm going to be speaking about the
[IndieWeb][] and the [Fediverse][] at this meetup; maybe I'll see you there?
