  I'll be :bullettrain_side: running around San Francisco tonight for the IndieWeb meetup and
  a newly minted dotfiles meetup!
---

Tonight's another chance to pull up to the [IndieWeb][] meetup held in San
Francisco! There's a bunch of them happening around the world - even a virtual
one. Be sure to check it out if you're in the area.


I'll also be heading to a [meetup around dotfiles][1] led by [Adarsh][2]. I'm
_super_ into what kind of things people stuff into their shell environments so
this is a place to catch me geeking out!
