After a bit of trouble with [Octopress][1], I decided to 
make my life a bit simpler and take it up a notch. I decided to start using
[Jekyll][2] after I've noticed a [few][3] [people][4] I knew use that as opposed to Octopress.
I see why now, just write your post and you're down.

Jekyll also gives one a chance to modularize their static work simply. I was
going to directly import my older theme for my website; but something stopped
me. It wasn't simple enough for my eye and I try to be as simple (but 
comprehensive) as possible. In order for this to happen, of course, I had to
start from scratch. Being a [Yeti lover][5], I decided to use it to work on this
blog, but with a [mobile first][6] approach. I went as far as to only look at my
Nexus 4 whilst checking for changes; and that was quite interesting of a go.

## Site Design

If you haven't noticed, this site is in my (favorite shade of purple)[^1].
I'm not quite sure *why* I like this color, but it sure as hell soothes me when
I look at it. The new simple layout was inspired from a few sources, primarily
being [Daniel Eden's][7] [own website][8] and [Matt Gemmell's][9] [blog][10];
two people I look towards when it comes to code and design.

By trade, I aim to be a hardcore back end developer. I avoid using
[graphical][11] [editing][12] tools and stick to my [favorite text editor][13]
with my personalized [configuration][14].


## Portfolio Building

Personally, I'm
not much of a (coder)[^2], but I'm working to become the one I have in mind.
However, it seems like the only way for me to get into the field and actually
have funds to keep myself alive would be to jump into the world of web
development. Don't get me wrong, pretty and shiny stuff make me happy; as well
as well designed (as far as I can tell) stuff. But I'm not one with a sense of
a visual knick knack. A few friends said I have, but I digress.

From what I notice, your personal site is your first line of "defense" when it
comes to portfolio building, so you might be able to tell why I was so eager to
make sure everything was *minimal*, *simple* and *responsive* (buzzwords, yay!).
Realistically, I'm going to bug a few friends, see what things they got going on
and build sites for them.

## Closing Notes

I'm taking this refresh as a chance for me to make things look anew for me;
perhaps as a way to make peace to myself and my coding ways. I'm going to do
this right; and I'm looking for all the help that I can get.
