In an attempt to make things a bit more minimal, I've redone the
top level of my website with a full page, two column approach. I got the
original concept of it from the older version of <http://jekyllrb.com>; it had a Dr.
Jekyll / Mr. Hyde look to it. I loved it and splashed my favorite color on
top of it for fun.

This had me realize that imitation is not only the highest form of flattery,
but also a good way to practice. Designing that page did reteach me some
concepts in centering text and block elements on a web page, something you'd
think would be direct, e.g.: `vertical-align` + `text-align`. There goes
project Minimal!

**EDIT 2013-08-31**: Now, I dropped the whole two column thing and just
have a centered 70% width column with a gutter of 15%. Fluid ftw.
