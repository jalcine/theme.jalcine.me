I haven't been giving myself enough time to write on here. I've written pieces
for myself in private and other people but it's nigh time I start using this
platform of mine for my intents. That said, I'm [launching a newsletter][1] in
a few days from the time of writing!

My mission is to send out links and thoughts of the one- to three-week range
that I found noteworthy and also allow myself to share the things that've
allowed me to grow and learn on a consistent basis. This will include things
like books, Twitter threads, other blog posts, imagery and more. A lot of the
content will be back-posted onto my blog under the "newsletter" category so
it'll be easier to view from a Web browser versus your email clients (if they
aren't in a Web browser, that is).

I'm excited to try this out - hope you'll join me over the new months!
