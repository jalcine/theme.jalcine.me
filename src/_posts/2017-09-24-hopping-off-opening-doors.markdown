excerpt: |
  A lot has happened in the last two weeks of life. I've entered funemployment,
  Good For POC is transitioning to being an open source platform and I'm
  launching a few more projects.

Quite a lot is notable to mention in this update. For starters, I'm no longer
with [Lyft][]. [Good For Poc][1] is now [open sourced][3] and will be a core
focus of mine these upcoming weeks. Also, a side project [I've softly alluded][4]
is going to be launching in the near future among other things. I write about
[this briefly][5] in my newsletter. You should [subscribe][].

After [some time][2], I've parted ways with Lyft. The reasons are complex and
the departure was bitter sweet but it was for the best. I learned a lot about
working on hockey-puck-growth like teams and was able to bring things that I've
learned into the environment. I speak more on the specifics of what I've done at
Lyft [on my resume][6]. In conjunction to engineering work and as a fierce
proponent for diversity and inclusion; I worked on Lyft's Black ERG as a co-lead
as well with as UpLyft Tech. These organizations gave me some really big ideas
on how more companies could approach diversity internally as well; things
that'll be carried onto the next spot. That place could be yours. [**Let me
know**][7].

## So [Good For Poc][1] is â€¦ Open?
Yeah! It was announced on our Twitter account recently:

We're going from a [statically generated Jekyll site][8] to serving a SPA that
communicates to a Sinatra application via GraphQL and a wee bit of REST
endpoints. If that doesn't make sense, that's fine :grinning:. The most
important thing is that [Good For PoC][1] is moving from a simpler
infrastructure to providing the general community a place to determine how their
company stands amongst the masses when it comes to diversity and inclusion. This
also opens the door to a lot more opportunity; all of which will be announced in
the near future.

This is also a great time for those looking to make their first contributions to
an open source project, those interested in working on a social good project
_or_ both to sink their teeth into. Let me know if you have any questions.

## What's This About Projects?
So a product I've been working on for, well, close to two years now. It's
something that's plagued me slightly since moving to the Bay and is totally a
first-world problem. But it's enough of a problem for me to want to build
something for it. I won't give all of the details here but those who are
subscribed to my mailing list will know the moment I release the alpha to the
public _and_ be able to access it two weeks earlier than most. Not on the list?
[Subscribe here][subscribe].

The most I'll say is that it _does_ deal with Twitter and tweets. That's about
it. Until then, you'll just get [this page][9] for now.

I thank _everyone_ who's been here on my pretty rapid journey. Mentors, friends
(new and old) and anyone who's lent a hand.
