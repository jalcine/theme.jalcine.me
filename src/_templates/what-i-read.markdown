I track my reading habits using [reading.am][] and occassionally, I work on
providing a week review of the things I've read here with a short blurb. This is
my way of writing a _really short_ book report but not for books and definitely
not a report.

That's it for this week. I take suggestions for things to read very openly via
email or Twitter. Let's see if I can keep this up :running:!
