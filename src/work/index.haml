    If you haven't yet, please [**learn a bit about me**][1]. I've been
    working as a **computer programmer** for five years now at companies like
    [Google][2], [Horizon Media][3], [BLS][4] and [Shutterstock][6]. I have a
    [Web version of my resume][7] and will provide a PDF version upon request.

    ## What I Can Do

    I'm a computer programmer that specializes in back-end Web development. I can
    build or work on the following:

      * Web services like shopping carts, blogs and marketing sites.
      * Tumblr and Wordpress themes (and Wordpress plugins if **absolutely** needed).
      * Bring websites up to current Web standards.
      * Improving websites to embrace responsive ideals.

    ## What I Don't Do

      + Native iOS applications **[why?][5]**,
      + Native Android applications **yet**,
      + Build unicorns and
      + Produce startups out of a box.

    ## Languages

    Most of the work I've done was in either Perl, JavaScript or Ruby. I have
    experience with PHP at a startup I worked at for a brief period of time before
    gears were switched to port the project's architecture to Rails.
