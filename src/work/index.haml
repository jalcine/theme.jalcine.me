    If you haven't yet, please [**learn a bit about me**][1]. I've been
    working as a **software engineer** for five years now at companies like
    [Google][2], [Horizon Media][3], [BLS][4] and [Shutterstock][6].

    ## What I Can Do

    I'm a software engineer that specializes in back-end Web development.

      * Websites like shopping carts, blogs and marketing sites.
      * Tumblr and Wordpress themes (and Wordpress plugins if absolutely needed).
      * Bring websites up to current Web standards.
      * Improve websites to embrace responsive ideals.
      * Build out service orientated architectures from pre-existing monolithic
        applications.

    ## What I Don't Do

      + Native iOS applications **[why?][5]**,
      + Native Android applications **yet**,
      + Build unicorns and
      + Produce startups out of a box.

    **Read up about [the languages I use][7]**.

    As of Mar 29, 2015, I haven't kept a "portfolio" since most of the work
    I've done for said components aren't either public facing (more backend
    facing). I'm currently working on a few projects to help rectify this. For
    those who find them useful, you can download [the latest copy of my resume
    here][resume] in PDF format. I cannot provide you a Word copy because I do
    not own a license to use Microsoft Office.
