      **I am a [**full-stack Web developer**](#background)**. Right now, I'm
      currently working at [**Clef**][clef] to eliminate passwords once and for all.

    :markdown
      I have worked as a **software developer** for five years now at companies
      like [Google][2], [Horizon Media][3], [BLS][4], [Shutterstock][6] and
      [Clef][8]. I **will not** provide a PDF version of my resume after
      discovering that recruiters have a habit of plastering their logos on top
      of the resumes. I find this disrespectful since it's done _without_ consent.

      ## Languages

      The work I've done was in either [**Perl**][11], [**JavaScript**][12] or
      [**Ruby**][13]. Other languages like **C++** and **Python** are languages I've
      worked with on personal projects but have not used in a production environment.

      I'm currently working on grasping [Elixir][9] and [Rust][10] as new languages
      of use.
