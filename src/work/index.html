    After working at <a href="https://getclef.com">Clef</a>, I learned a lot
    about the importance of having enforced company values that not only focused
    on the product but also on how each employee interacted with one another.
    Below are some things I look for in companies I work at and plan to work
    with in the future.
  </p>
  <ul class="list f4">
    <li>Diversity at the forefront</li>
    <li>Mentorship for investment in talent</li>
    <li>Growth in self and in the team</li>
    <li>Avoid automatic exclusion</li>
    <li>Reciprocate trust in users and teams</li>
