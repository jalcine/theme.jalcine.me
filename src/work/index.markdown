  If you haven't yet, please [**learn a bit about me**][1]. I've been
  working as a **computer programmer** for five years now at companies like
  [Google][2], [Horizon Media][3], [BLS][4] and [Shutterstock][6].

  ## What I Can Do

  I'm a computer programmer that specializes in back-end Web development. I can
  build or work on the following:

    * Web services like shopping carts, blogs and marketing sites.
    * Tumblr and Wordpress themes (and Wordpress plugins if **absolutely** needed).
    * Bring websites up to current Web standards.
    * Improving websites to embrace responsive ideals.
    * Build out service orientated architectures from pre-existing monolithic
      applications.

  ## What I Don't Do

    + Native iOS applications **[why?][5]**,
    + Native Android applications **yet**,
    + Build unicorns and
    + Produce startups out of a box.

  As of `2015-05-04`, I haven't kept a "portfolio" since most of the work
  I've done for said components aren't either public facing (more back-end
  facing). I'm currently working on a few projects to help rectify this. For
  those who find them useful, you can obtain [my resume][resume] in PDF format.
  I cannot provide you a Microsoft Word copy because I do not own a license to
  use Microsoft Office, largely out of choice.

  ## Languages

  Most of the work I've done was in either Perl, JavaScript or Ruby. I have
  experience with PHP at a startup I worked at for a brief period of time before
  gears were switched to port the project's architecture to Rails. The following
  table shows my percentages in respective languages for provided categories.
