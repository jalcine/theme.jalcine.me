  <strong>Jacky Alciné</strong> is a software developer that works with Web platforms
  leaning towards the back end platform. He works, however, as a full stack
  web developer very eager to experiment with new technologies whilst remaining
  very partial with providing platform support to as many users as possible. He
  also tinkers with technology that bridge the Web to physical hardware.
  Outside of software development, he's working to become a high school
  teacher that aims to capture, cultivate and assist in the development of
  youth and young adults. This education route will involve the heavy
  decolonization of the information presented to our youth currently to ensure
  a healthy Pan-Afrikanist approach to mental development is available.
