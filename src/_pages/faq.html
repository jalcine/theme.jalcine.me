    I try to keep my code <a target="_blank"
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">
      DRY</a>. However, when it comes to answering questions, I either answer
    them incorrectly or don't give a good enough answer. This page serves as a
    place to centralize all of those questions and answers. So, we got {{
    site.faq | size }} questions that you can explore!

    <strong>Note</strong>: You can always <mark>ask me a question</mark>
    <a href="/contact/">directly</a>. With your permission, I'll post it on
    my website with your attribution.
