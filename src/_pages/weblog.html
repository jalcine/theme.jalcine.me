    I like using the Internet a lot. I think I spend at least four hours each
    day interacting with it with various devices. This and the experiences
    I have in my life I capture here in my <strong>weblog</strong>. Some people
    call them <em>blogs</em>, <em>web journals</em> or just <em>sites</em>. This
    is my blog. It has {{ site.posts.size }} posts since {{ site.posts.last.date | date: "%Y" }}.
