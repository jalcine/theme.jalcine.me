      I keep a few ways for those interested in my updates to stay in tune with
      my activities. My <a href="#newsletter">Newsletter</a> is the best way, as
      it also gives you a direct line of communication with me.

      My newsletter is a bimonthly curation of thoughts collected over time,
      things too short for a blog post and too useful for Twitter. I'd also
      add a few other fun things into them.
