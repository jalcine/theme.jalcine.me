  I try to keep my code <a target="_blank"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">
    DRY</a>. However, when it comes to answering questions, I either answer
  them incorrectly or don't give a good enough answer. This page serves as a
  place to centralize all of those questions and answers. So, we got {{
  site.faq | size }} questions that you can explore!
