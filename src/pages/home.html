  Hey. I'm Jacky. I <a href="/faq/hobbies">do a bunch of stuff</a>, nearly every
  day.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  I've been writing and hosting my own site on the Internet since 2010. The last
  post I've written was <a href="{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{ site.posts[0].title
    }}</a>.This site is a  <a href="/faq/indieweb">IndieWeb</a>-friendly site to
  note &mdash; it's how the Internet was invisioned.

<p class="lead">
  I'd talk more about myself on my <em>home</em> page but that'd detract from
  other parts of my site. I have pages that tell you <a href="/gear/">what I
    use</a>, <a href="/subscribe/">how to stay in touch</a> even
  <a href="/now/">what I'm doing now</a>.
