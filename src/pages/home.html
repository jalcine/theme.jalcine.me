      I write on this website to share my stories to the world. I've been doing
      it since 2010. This site is a <a href="/faq/indieweb/">Level 1 IndieWeb</a>
      site.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy measure tj f3">
      I recently wrote <a href="{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{ site.posts[0].title }}
      </a>. I have <a href="/weblog/">more posts available</a> as well.
    </p>
    <p class="lh-copy measure tj f4 pr3-l">
      I'd talk more about myself on my <em>home</em> page but that'd detract from
      other parts of my site. I have pages that tell you <a href="/gear/">what I
        use</a>, <a href="/work/">what I tend to do during the day</a>,
      <a href="/subscribe/">how to stay in touch</a> even
      <a class="white" href="/now/">what I'm doing now</a>. Lastly, I've created a place for you
      to <a href="/contact/">reach out to me</a>. I want this site to be a decent
      reflection of myself but also provide value to you. Let me know what helps
      you be a better you.
