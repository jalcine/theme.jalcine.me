  I keep a few ways for those interested in my updates to stay in tune with
  my activities. My <a href="#newsletter">newsletter</a> is currently the best 
  way, as it also gives you a direct line of communication with me with context
  to my latest adventures.

    My newsletter is a <strike>bimonthly</strike> now weekly curation of
    thoughts collected over time, things too short for a blog post and 
    too useful for Twitter. I'd also add a few other fun things into 
    them. <strong>Join along today</strong>.

    I keep RSS feeds of things I write on my <a href="/weblog/">weblog</a> so
    you don't have to keep coming here to check it out. I also keep a list of
    the podcasts I've recently listened to as well as links I've noted across
    the Web.

    There's also these services that people use to keep in touch and stay
    "tuned in". I'm on there (a bit too much, to be frank). If you end up
    following me on Twitter, I <em>strongly recommend</em> turning off my
    retweets. I don't have a quarter million tweets for nothing.
