  I actively do contract web development work with languages like JavaScript,
  Ruby, Python and Elixir. Contact me for rates and information. As an avid
  consumer of the Web, I really want to know how I can help you get your ideas,
  projects and thoughts on there with ease.

  view the world. I enjoy being able to work on tools and utilities that help
  improve the landscape.
