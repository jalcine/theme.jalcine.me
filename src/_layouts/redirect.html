    So the page <code>{{ page.redirect.from }}</code> doesn't exist anymore. My
    bad. Instead, you'll have to go to <code><a href="{{ page.redirect.to }}">{{
        page.redirect.to }}</a></code>. By the time you're finished reading
    this, your browser will probably start that process.

    If you got here from a dead link that <em>I posted</em>, let me know and I'll
    try to update it!
