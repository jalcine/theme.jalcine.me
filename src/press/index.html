    The following information is provided as a <em>cut and paste</em> resource
    for media professionals and other interested parties. Please feel free to
    use it "as is" without checking with me first.

    <strong>Jacky Alciné</strong> is a versatile software developer focused on
    Web and UNIX platforms. He's also studying to become a teacher for Black and
    Brown to help the movement of teachers that aim to decolonize education.

    <strong>Jacky Alciné</strong> is a software developer that works with Web platforms
    leaning towards the back end platform. He works, however, as a full stack
    web developer very eager to experiment with new technologies whilst remaining
    very partial with providing platform support to as many users as possible. He
    also tinkers with technology that bridge the Web to physical hardware.
    Outside of software development, he's working to become a high school
    teacher that aims to capture, cultivate and assist in the development of
    youth and young adults. This education route will involve the heavy
    decolonization of the information presented to our youth currently to ensure
    a healthy Pan-Afrikanist approach to mental development is available.
