  ## About This Site
  This website is created using [Jekyll][], [Sass][], [Haml][] and a few extra
  extensions for [Jekyll][jekyllblogplugins]. The source code to most of the 
  website is on [Github][]. You might find a few icons from the [Font Awesome][]
  project here as well.

  ## About Jacky
  I'm a software engineer that's been programming since 2010, recreationally 
  since 2009, but that doesn't matter. I take an interest into learning more 
  about methodologies of software engineering which in turn led to me picking
  up quite a few languages to play with different quirks and styles 
  (and indenting, jeez, the indenting).

  ## Contact
  Although I never do mind a face-to-face chat, I'm most comfortable when
  sending e-mail to &amp; fro. An address of contact is **hello@jalcine.me**.
  I look forward to hearing from you (even more awesome if it has a nice present!).
