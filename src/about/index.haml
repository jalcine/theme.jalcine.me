  # About
  **I'm Jacky**. I live in [Brooklyn, New York][bk] with lineage to [HaÃ¯ti][hi].
  I spend too much time in front of my [laptop][] when I'm either at home or at
  a space where I can use it (which tends to be almost anywhere). I'm an
  unapologetically Black cishetero male and if the concepts of equal rights for
  Black people (and minorities as a whole) is trippy, you've just made a `403`, pal.

  ## Social Media
  I've stopped using my Facebook account in a personal attempt to severe ties
  with their browser data collection tactics. It sucks because a lot of friends
  and family _still_ use the platform but for now, it's a loss I can accept.
  I primarily use [Twitter][tw] as my primary social media platform of choice
  because it's not too demanding on attention, in a sense. You get what you put
  into it, sans the trolling and abusive behavior of other humans that inhabit
  this planet. I've also decided against splitting my online presence from being
  a "professional" then more "lax" experience because the act of assimilation
  to a public that requires me to diminish the parts of me that makes me who I
  am (music, food, etc) is only to make others who aren't like me more
  comfortable as opposed to learning about (but not appropriating) said culture.

  ## Programming
  My dad gave me a book on C++ programming back in 2006. I read it over that
  summer and kept tinkering with little text games on a box running Windows XP.
  From there, I learned about [Ubuntu][] in 2009 and kept using it since then.
  I wrote a [bit more about this][start] and plan to follow up with it when it makes
  ten years.

  ## Photography
  Oh God. So when I said I took pictures, I meant it. But they tend to not
  have people in them. They're kind of hard to take pictures of. I'm working on
  it though. I put my pictures where most photographers tend to, on [Flickr][].
  Don't laugh.

  ## This Site
  This site's a mash of Markdown, HTML, Sass and JavaScript. To many, this can
  equate to a evolving ball of hell or a perfect symphony of art. I don't know,
  you can check over at its source code tree on [Github][tree].
