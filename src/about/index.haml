  # About
  I'm Jacky. I'm from [Brooklyn, New York][bk] with lineage to [HaÃ¯ti][hi],
  I spend too much time in front of my [laptop][] when I'm either at home or at
  a space where I can use it (which tends to be almost anywhere). I'm an
  unapologetically Black cisgender male and if the concepts of equal rights for
  Blacks (or minorities as a whole) is trippy, you've just made a `403`, pal.

  ## Programming
  My dad gave me a book on C++ programming back in 2006. I read it over that
  summer and kept tinkering with little text games on a box running Windows XP.
  From there, I learned about [Ubuntu][] in 2009 and kept using it since then.

  ## Photography
  Oh God. So when I said I took pictures, I meant it. But they tend to not
  have people in them. They're kind of hard to take pictures of. I'm working on
  it though. I put my pictures where most photographers tend to, on [Flickr][].
  Don't laugh.

  ## This Site
  This site's a mash of Markdown, HTML, Sass and JavaScript. To many, this can
  equate to a evolving ball of hell or a perfect symphony of art. I don't know,
  you can check over at its source code tree on [Github][tree].
