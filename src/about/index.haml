  # About
  **I'm Jacky**. I live in [Oakland, California][oak] and grew up in [Brooklyn, 
  New York][bk] with lineage to [Ha√Øti][hi]. I spend too much time in
  front of my [laptop][] when I'm either at home or at [a space where
  I can use it][1] (which tends to be almost anywhere). I'm an
  unapologetically Black cishetero male and if the concepts of equal rights
  for Black people (and URM as a whole) is trippy, you've just made
  a `403`, pal. There's a 68% chance you've come here from Twitter, according to
  analytics. So yeah. Restricting myself to 140 characters is insulting and
  requires me to make up a quip-like statement. _Not about it, fam_.
  I'm not here to sugarcoat shit; I do my best as straight of a shooter as
  I can.

  ## Social Media
  I primarily use [Twitter][tw] as my primary social media platform of choice
  because it's not too demanding on attention, in a sense. You get what you put
  into it, sans the trolling and abusive behavior of other humans that inhabit
  this planet. I've also decided against splitting my online presence from being
  a "professional" then more "lax" experience because the act of assimilation
  to a public that requires me to diminish the parts of me that makes me who I
  am (music, food, etc) is only to make others who aren't like me more
  I also [listen to music][lastfm], [read & watch videos][ram] and [listen to
  podcasts][gpod].

  ## Press
  **Are you writing about me?** Visit [here][press] for some blurbs and images.
  ### Photography
  Whenever I do happen to walk with my camera, I take some pictures of what I
  find interesting. I take the best of shots and place them on [Flickr][].

  ## Programming
  My dad gave me a book on C++ programming back in 2006. I read it over that
  summer and kept tinkering with little text games on a box running Windows XP.
  From there, I learned about [Ubuntu][] in 2009 and kept using it since then.
  I wrote a [bit more about this][start] and plan to follow up with it when it makes
  ten years. Right now, I work on a [few personal projects][prj] to keep the blade sharp.
  I host my public facing code on [Github][] and some more personal repositories on
  [cgit][].

  [If you want, we can pair program](/pairwithme/).

  ## This Site
  This site's a mash of Markdown, HTML, Sass and JavaScript. To many, this can
  equate to a evolving ball of hell or a perfect symphony of art. I don't know,
  you can check over at its source code tree on [Github][tree].
