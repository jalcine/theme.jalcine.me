  I'm Jacky. I'm from <a

    title="Brooklyn, New York"><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong></a>.
  I spend too much time in front of my <a href="/gear/laptop#current" title="My
    Current Laptop">laptop</a> when I'm either at home or at a space where I
  can use it (which tends to be almost anywhere).

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>
  My dad gave me a book on C++ programming back in 2006. I read it over that
  summer and kept tinkering with little text games on a Windows XP machine.
  From there, I learned about <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> and kept
  using it since then. I have <a href="/projects">some projects</a> that I'm
  willing to claim. If you're even more curious, check out my
  <a href="https://github.com/jalcine">Github</a> account.

<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>
  Oh God. So when I said I took pictures, I meant it. But they tened to not
  have people in them. They're kind of hard to take pictures of. I'm working on
  it though. I put my pictures where most photographers tend to, on
  <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/jackyalcine">Flickr</a>. Don't laugh.

<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>
  This site's a mash of Markdown, HTML, Sass and JavaScript. To many, this can
  equate to a evolving ball of hell or a perfect symphony of art. I don't know,
  you can check over at its tree on <a href="https://github.com/jalcine/jalcine.me">Github</a>.
