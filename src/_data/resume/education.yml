  In conjunction to working as a [_skilled software engineer_](/work/resume/tech),
  Jacky has worked in classrooms with youth ranging in grades 5 - 12 on
  introduction to software courses. He takes the experiences and educational
  tracks of his life to connect to youth in a more colloquially reputable fashion.

  **I'm eager to expand this part** of my background, please reach out to me

    blurb: |
      A few friends and parents got together to teach some local youth about
      game development. The goal was to have them going from knowing nothing
      about software development or game theory to building a simple 2D
      side-scroller. We met at the Youth Space in Central Library of the
      Brooklyn Public Library branch. About ten kids (aged from 12 - 16) met
      regularly and would go through guided coursework to learn how to build
      games using Phaser. I focused on the game engine logic and helping
      students that fell off from instruction paths or who wanted more insight.

    blurb: |
      A friend connected me with a set of youth at his former high school to
      introduce them to computer science (namely algorithms). We met twice a
      week as part of an after school program. The classes were terminated
      after a brief run due to the holidays in New York City and dropping off of
      interest from the youth.
