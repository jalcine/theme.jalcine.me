  question: Where do you work?

  question: What do you like doing?
  answer: |
    It revolves around [reading][1], cooking or just centering myself. That
    act of centering takes form through exercise, meditation or any other activity
    that forces me to connect with my body more.

    I also look for ways to expand my knowledge of software tools available for
    independent creators and the consumers alike. Like <http://indieweb.org>.
