          My laptop of choice is the [Dell XPS 14][1] with 500 GB of disk space,
          32 GB SSD and a [Intel i7-3537U][2] core. With 8 GB SDDRAM3 @ 1.6 GHz,
          a moderately decent set of cores &mdash; gets the job done.
          Bluetooth is in there as well and it has a backlit keyboard which
          really helps at night. A nugget of gold about this laptop? Under the
          bottom left corner of the keyboard, a button lights up to five LEDs,
          letting you know how much power is left.

          Most of the shots I have taken come from my nifty [Nikon L830][1]
          since it's mostly automatic when it comes to handling. I really just
          tweak ISO, white balance and focus with this camera. However, the
          [Nikon D3200][2] handles a lot better, takes way better shots but
          requires me to fiddle with it a bit more. This might be me handling
          it incorrectly; we'll find out.

          Nothing too fantastic here. I got this because it was a bit more
          friendly to left-handed mouse users (one of the few!) thus making it
          worthwhile. It doubles as my road mouse as well.

        bio: |
          I'm one of those Linux purists you might have heard of. I use Android
          on my phone and run Linux on my laptop machine. People might call me
          wild, I enjoy it. I run [KDE Plasma 5][1] on my desktop machine with
          the latest kernel additions (always stay up-to-date).

          ### Software
          I try to use as much KDE tools as possible. That means me making use
          of the whole Akondai suite and what not. Granted, the one application
          I probably use the most is Konsole. After that, neovim is a tight
          contender.
