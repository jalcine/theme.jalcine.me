          I made the upgrade earlier in 2018 to the [Dell Inspiron 13][1]. I got
          it souped it as a thank-you gift to myself. Sadly, not a ton of Linux
          environments are tailored for touch screens so things like pop up
          keyboards, gesture recognition or even screen rotation work out of the box.
          Sounds like a hack project!

          Most of the shots I have taken come from my nifty [Nikon L830][1]
          since it's mostly automatic when it comes to handling. I really just
          tweak ISO, white balance and focus with this camera. However, the
          [Nikon D3200][2] handles a lot better, takes way better shots but
          requires me to fiddle with it a bit more. This might be me handling
          it incorrectly; we'll find out.

          Nothing too fantastic here. I got this because it was a bit more
          friendly to left-handed mouse users (one of the few!) thus making it
          worthwhile. It doubles as my road mouse as well.

          I got this [mouse from Anker][1] for my home use and my wrist can't 
          keep thanking me. If you have the option, switch to this and feel
          the moments of wrist pain just disappear.

        bio: |
          I'm one of those Linux purists you might have heard of. I use Android
          on my phone and run Linux on my laptop machine. People might call me
          wild, I enjoy it. I run [KDE Plasma 5][1] on my desktop machine with
          the latest kernel additions (always stay up-to-date).

          ### Software
          I try to use as much KDE tools as possible. That means me making use
          of the whole Akondai suite and what not. Granted, the one application
          I probably use the most is Konsole. After that, neovim is a tight
          contender.
