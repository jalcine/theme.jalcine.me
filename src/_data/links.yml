      Have a Web application that you've been meaning to hash out? Need to do
      some performance tweaks to your blog? Feel like your SEO game isn't up to

      I keep myself busy - idle mind, as the saying goes. It's not all work for
      me though. Find out more about my moves and how they relate to you and
      your endeavors by subscribing.

      It's also an *excellent* way to get perks on projects, events and other
      things colleagues and I are working on.

      As well in my subscriptions, I've been working to keep my projects all in
      sync and in check. Things like [twch.at](http://app.twch.at) and
      [goodforpoc](http://goodforpocin.tech) are all in there.
