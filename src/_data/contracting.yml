      With my badckground, I've seen and implemented plenty of solutions that
      aim to improve performance of your server-side application issues. Working
      closely with application performance monitor tooling I can provide and set
      up for your teams to make the more appropriate choices for your
      product.

    title: "Reusable Software"
    content: |
      Good carpenters measure twice then cut once. I aim and deliver software
      that, when the case arises, can be used in other situations across the
      organization such that one interface of it can be expanded for the
      use-cases of others. This folds into my heavy use and reliance on
      open-source software and my yearn to contribute as much as I can to it to
      ease the development cycle for developers.

    title: "Well Networked"
    content: |
      Not even going to front, I'm a software developer. I'm not a designer or a
      UX expert. I'm fortunate, however, to have a lot of industry-leading
      individuals in my corner to help you figure out where you stand with your
      project design. That coupled with my solid understanding of translating 
      design needs and requirements into engineering goals makes the whole
      process seamless.

    title: "Avid Learning"

      I'm still looking for projects that I haven't been able to pick up yet! I
      learned how to maintain and handle Android applications _on the fly_ in
      the past. It's now something I work on for side projects and keep a tuned
      ear towards.
