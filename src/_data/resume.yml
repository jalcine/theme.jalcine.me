    role: SWE (Server), Communications Platform
    time:
      start: Janaury 2017
      end: September 2017
    blurb: |
      I worked on the **Notifications** team (now known as the
      **Communications Platform**) that handled all of the incoming and
      outgoing forms of messaging that users of the Lyft platform dealt with.
      This ranged from telephony software that routed calls from drivers to
      passengers as well as communications to passengers from Lyft about states
      of their account. I introduced the base of template tools that would be
      used to handle semantically relevant content to users.

      I also sat as a co-lead on the Lyft Black ERG, **Uplyft Forward**. I
      introduced two community building events around media, pop culture and
      social interactions that allow fellow Black employees of any organization
      within Lyft to find a sense of community amongst one another. I also
      facilitated an internal teaching around the genesis and prevalence of
      Juneteenth, allowing allies and identifying members alike to learn about
      the importance of said event.

    role: SWE (Server, Web, Android)
    time:
      start: November 2015
      end: November 2016
    blurb: |
      In my year at Clef, I was given the opportunity to work on all aspects 
      of the platform. This ranged from the Android platform where I was tasked
      to incorporate new features that aligned the emerging device support of
      newer Android versions as well as adding feature parity for discovering
      new applications Clef supported. I had a hand in moving from on-the-metal
      development to the VM-based systems which gave way to the Docker-based
      infrastructure Clef runs today. 

      As part of my initial work on Android for Clef, I wrote out the SDK used
      for another product Clef launched called [Instant 2FA][1]. It was designed
      to be a drop-in module using RxJava and other libraries for high
      performance and an elegant user experience.
