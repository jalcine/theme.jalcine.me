    John Barger coined the term <strong>weblog</strong> at the end of 1997 but
    still to this day, we use it as a means of representing the digital long
    form text people use to encapsulate thoughts, moments and experiences over
    time. This is where I hold mine. So for, I've written
    {{ paginator.total_posts }} here since 2012 on this site. I have older
    entries on <a href="https://bloger.com" target="_blank">Blogger</a>
    from 2009 on but  that's another lifetime ago.

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <time datetime="{{ post.date }}">{{ post.date | date: "%b %d %y" }}</time>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">
        {{ post.title }}
      </a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
