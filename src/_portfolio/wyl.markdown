# Technology
The stack is a **Ruby on Rails** one hosted on **Heroku**. It
involves tools like **Sidekiq** and the caching service **Redis** to
handle long polling background jobs as well as intermittent information
about transactions occurring on the platform.

# Objectives
WhoseYourLandlord, at the time that I worked on their project, is a Ruby on
Rails application. A project I focused on there was improving rental listing
discovery for renters as well as sanitizing address inputs for realtors who came
in to claim a listing. The goal was also to make it more feasible to
import hundreds of listings across the Web into the platform with relevant
metadata such that on first viewing of said listing on the platform, it'd
be likely to be the choice of the visitor.

### Developer Centric
I also worked on improving the test suite for more predictability into
changes made in the platform. This made my work a lot more easier. Adding
**acceptance tests** also gave me the added benefit of seeing what the
page looked like at each step and gave stakeholders a glimpse into what
the end result would be like.
