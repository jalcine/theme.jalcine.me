# Objectives

WhoseYourLandlord, at the time that I worked on their project, is a Ruby on
Rails application. A project I focused on there was improving rental listing
discovery for renters as well as sanitizing address inputs for realtors who came
in to claim a listing.

# About

The following is grabbed from [WhoseYourLandlord's website][1]:

> [WYL is] giving renters ownership of their living situation by putting housing
> in their hands. Through landlord reviews, community insights, neighborhood
> engagement, and available listings, we're ensuring that all WYL renters have
> a smooth and quality experience throughout their search and stay. For home
> providers, we’re providing feedback on ways they can improve, providing
> renter snapshots so they can better understand who they’re renting to, and
> we’re creating simple tools to seamlessly post and get rentals booked.
