description: A platform for discovering companies for people of color to work at.
---

The following is taken verbatim from the [How it Works][1] page:

> Good for PoC is a survey that can be filled out by people of color working at
> tech companies. Itâ€™s meant to be a measure of how people of color in the
> tech industry are treated/feel included at the companies they work for.
>
> Good for PoC is meant to serve people of color, not the companies that are
> submitted. Filling out the survey does not mean that your company will be
> listed on the site.

> Our goal is to provide an anonymous and safe space for people of color to
> share their experiences at the companies they work for. We encourage those
> who identify as people of color to fill out the survey. 


The platform is open source, the [client][2] and [API][3] are being actively
worked on. Feel free to hop in if you have an idea for the platform.
