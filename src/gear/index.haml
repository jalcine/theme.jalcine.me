    the stuff that I like doing like writing software or take pictures.

  %p
    :markdown
      My laptop of choice is the [Dell XPS 14][laptop] with 500 GB of disk space,
      32 GB SSD and a [Intel i7-3537U core][core]. With 8 GB SDDRAM3 @ 1.6 GHz,
      it's relatively fast and gets the job done. Bluetooth's in there as well
      and it has a backlit keyboard which really helps at night. It has a shoddy
      web camera though, only 2 megapixels. The speakers, however, are amazing
      (before I messed them up). They really boom despite them behind under the
      laptop. And they're practically invisible. A nugget of gold about this
      laptop? Under the bottom left corner of the keyboard, a button lights
      up to five LEDs, letting you know how much power's left. More useful
      then it should be!

      Most of the shots I've taken come from my nifty [Nikon L830][l830]
      since it's mostly automatic when it comes to handling. I really
      just tweak ISO, white balance and focus with this camera.
      However, the [Nikon D3200][d3200] handles a lot better, takes way better
      shots but requires me to fiddle with it a bit more. This might be me
      handling it incorrectly; we'll find out.

    %a{name: "mouse"} Mouse
  %p
    :markdown
      The cool kids are using track pads and what not. I not only like
      sticking to my mouse, I use it on the left side. I've done this
      for a long time (about 3 years now) and I noticed that I tend to
      place drinks and food to the right side and having a moving target
      over there was dangerous. So I invested in the [Logitech M150][mouse].
      Best investment EVAH!

  %address Updated January 10, 2015

  Most of the files for replicating my environment is over on Github for the
  %a{href: "https://github.com/jalcine/dotfiles"} shell
  and
  %a{href: "https://github.com/jalcine/kderc"} KDE
  repositories.

  %h3 Terminal Emulator
  %p
    :markdown
      I spend too much time in [Konsole][] after trying out things
      like [FinalTerm][] and [GNOME Terminal][] on Linux machines.
      Konsole supports more colors and is very flexible with glyph rendering.
      I use the [Base 16 Ocean][clr] color scheme for the emulator.
      It's not completely black in the background, but it's dark enough
      to be a backdrop of sorts. The typeface used is [monoOne][] and it
      works really well at size 9 **and** comes with Powerline symbol support.

  %h3 Shell
  %p
    :markdown
      As most developers might, I use [Bash][] as my default shell.
      I use [homeshick][] to set up a system of shell configuration files for
      [vim][], [git][], [tmux][] and [anything else that isn't big][dot]
      enough to pull out into a separate repository.

      I use Vim as my primary text editor and like using [KDE][] software due to its
      synergy. [KMail][], [KOrganizer][] and [Krita][] are all tools I use
      too often. Despite all of that, I've picked up [i3][] as my primary window
      manager. As a user of tmux and vim, this was the natural choice.
