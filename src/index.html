  <h2>Hi, I'm Jacky!</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    I'm a guy who really likes computers and cartoons. You can <a
    href="/about/">learn more about me</a>. I tend to <a
    href="https://github.com/jalcine">write software</a> meant to work
    on the Internet but I'm working on expanding that! I occassionally write this
    in text files and push them onto <a href="/weblog/">my weblog</a>.

  <h3>Why So Bland?</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    This website doesn't use flashy CSS or anything <em>too recent</em>. It's
    really because that's not the focus of what I do (not entirely at least).
    Instead, I'm aiming to improve the quality by pushing information I've found
    <em>really useful</em>! Doesn't mean I'll try to work on it later!
