      I'm a software engineer that focuses on ease of access for user
      security on the Web as well as digital literacy for silicon based consumer
      networked electronics (or "tech"). My mission is to carry out the objective of
      my parents and that of my ancestors: to focus on the liberation of my people
      and the restoration of the descendants of the African Diaspora.

    I like movies and television, especially ones that focus on comics,

    Liberation for Oppressed People
  </h2>
  <p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
    Growing in a country with centuries of bloodstain history against a myriad
    of people, I had to understand that it's irresponsible for me to not ensure
    equitable places when presented the opportunity to do so.

  <h3 class="lh-solid tracked-mega ttu">All Power to The People</h3>
  <p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
    My focus is to provide people with tools to combat oppressive regimes that
    aim to exterminate their freedom and revoke their human rights.

    <strong>Let's face it</strong>. Thanks to capitalism, in order to live in
