      I'm an Oakland based software engineer that focuses on ease of access for user
      security on the Web as well as digital literacy for silicon based consumer
      networked electronics (or "tech"). My mission is to carry out the objective of
      my parents and that of my ancestors: to focus on the liberation of my people
      and the restoration of the descendants of the African Diaspora.
