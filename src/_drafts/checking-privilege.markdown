**I'm a Black cisgender heterosexual male in NYC.**

Saying that alone affirms a level of privilege that I'm born with as well
levels of prejudice that's been placed against me irrespective of my actions.
This is my attempt to review said privileges and prejudices as well as making
it more of a concern of mine to _check_ my privilege when I overstep[^1].


[^1]: Or to prevent overstepping altogether.
