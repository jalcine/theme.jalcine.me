There's been a trend recently with large corporations to sway public opinion
about their awareness to social injustices. The new "in" thing to do is to tweet
out a little statement or hold some sort of social media campaign to let people
know that they're thinking of us. Now, this comment doesn't aim to discredit the
work of employee resource groups in companies that are predominately like the
list of presidents in the country (before Obama) that, not too long ago, made it
_legal_ to commit said injustices.

I find it not only dishonest but also disrespectufl and insulting to those who
work every day to ensure that Black lives have a safe space to go in a country
founded on the notion that Black and cow lives were equatable, if not
exchangable.
