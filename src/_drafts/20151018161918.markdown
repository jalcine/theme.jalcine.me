I have two big announcements that I'm more than honored to share with you all.
The first one is that I'm moving to California! Leaving my ever-loved home of
Brooklyn, NY to land in the East Bay. I'm feeling a mixture of excitement, fear
and joy all the same time. The move is one I've wanted to make for a _long time_
but didn't have the momentary availability or requirement to do so. That leads
me to my second announcement! As of 2nd Nov 2015, I'll be the 8th employee over
at [Clef][]. If, somehow, you don't know what they[^1] do, [start here][1].

That's all I'll say **for now**. Just wanted y'all to know!
