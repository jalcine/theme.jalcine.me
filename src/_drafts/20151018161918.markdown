I have two big announcements that I'm more than honored to share with you all.
The first one is that I'm moving to California! Leaving my ever-loved home of
Brooklyn, NY to land in the East Bay. I'm feeling a mixture of excitement, fear
and joy all the same time. The move is one I've wanted to make for a _long time_
but didn't have the momentary availability or requirement to do so. That leads
me to my second announcement! As of 2nd Nov 2015, I'll be the 8th employee over
at [Clef][]. If, somehow, you don't know what they[^1] do, [start here][1].

If you feel like you know me, you'd know that this is one hell of a change for
me. I'm a Brooklyn guy through and through but that was one of the many reasons
that led to my choice in moving out to California. I've been asked so many
questions about the process:

  * Where are you going to live?
  * How will you adjust? You can't even drive or ride a bike!
  * WHAT ABOUT BAE?[^2]

All of these have been resolved and figured out. I've even decided to work on a
photo blog kind of thing using Flickr as the store and perhaps this blog to
expand on each photo and my experience there. We'll see how things play out.

[^1]: Well, now we! :grin:
[^2]: The number of times I've been asked this (and how it's almost always the second question)...
