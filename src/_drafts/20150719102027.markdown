Reading is fun! Kids tend to really enjoy it[^1], so I'd recommend doing a lot
of it. I'll take a shot in the dark and say that you use some sort of reading
list tool to keep a list of things you'd like to finish reading at a later time.
Things like [Read It Later, or Pocket][2], [Safari's in-built reading list][3]
or [Wallabag][3] really make this a lot easier. But when it comes to time to
actually read everything in the list; the number of un-read articles get really
daunting. At the time of writing, my unread article count in Wallabag is sitting
at 1,083 articles. There's absolutely no way I'd be able to read all of these
articles if I had time since most are probably irrelevant by now in terms of
interest.

Instead of scrolling through random titles, I take advantage of Wallabag's
'random article' feature to pick an article from the list and present it for
reading. This, of course, has its ups and downs. Say that I do this for 10
articles and decide to archive the rest 1,073. I lose out on reading a
potentially captivating article that could have changed my life! Given that an
article had so much potential; one would think that it'd float back to one's
attention if it was meant to be.
