I was reading two posts on the topic of (or probably on the purpose behind)
test-driven development in Ruby web applications, specifically Rails. I'm being
super-specific here mainly because the kind of application you write and the
language it's done in really affects the kind of testing you can do. Writing
feature tests in C++ isn't as easy as writing them in Ruby mainly because of
the state of type system in both languages (static vs dynamic), off the top of
my head. Daniel H. Hanselman speaks very boldly for someone who hasn't picked
up much when it comes to computer software theory but neither have I. It's not
like I've gone to school to it, but a good chunk of what I know was learned
through various patterns
