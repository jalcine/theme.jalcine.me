  I completely nuked jacky.wtf from low-orbit.

I've been toying around with a new system setup for my personal server. I named
the original one Krypton and it's hit that point where I needed to send data
elsewhere. I wasnâ€™t sure what was stored on there and over time, disk space
became next to 0. I actually took the entire server off-line for a few days[^1]

## The Vision

I'm aiming to get more into the world of [POSSE][] and the [Indie Web][]
in general. Despite being someone who works at a [PDaaS company][1],
I still believe that the producer of data is the only true owner of
it[^2]. This, unexpectedly, made me realize that there's a _LOT_ of things
that one can do when they own and host their own systems. You have a lot
more control over who gets to it and how accurate it has to be. I also can
feel a lot more comfortable dumping more information in there.

### Personal Website

https://jacky.wtf itself is hosted on DigitalOcean, by way of nginx &amp;
jekyll (to name a few tools). The new version of this site, well, is the
same.

[^2]: At the time of writing, my place of employment aligns with this idea too.
