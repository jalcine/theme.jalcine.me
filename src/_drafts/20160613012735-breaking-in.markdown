  I reflect on points made by Amelie on how people in the industry can help
  people who wish to become better developers grow into the roles they'd like to
  see themselves in.

I read [@amelielamont][]'s post on the role people _in_ the industry play in
teaching other people how to be more valued and skilled workers[^1]. If there's
one thing that's becoming commodifying, it's definitely developers. Recently,
it's branched out into design on some training platforms, but I still fear that
people are being handed some tools with about four steps on how to use them but
never any contxtual awareness on why these tools _are_ perhaps the best ones
they'll ever get or if those tools should be discarded altogether.
