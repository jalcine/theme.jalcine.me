title: Getting Emoji as a First-Class Citizen (Sorta)

I've craved for the day that I could use emoji anywhere from the console. Right
now in Firefox, I [use an extension to handle copy and pasting][1] of emoji but
this can only take one so far. Just hitting a few strokes on the keyboard
_should_ be enough to get emoji going and thanks to [eevee's `.XCompose`][2]
file, it seems VERY possible.
