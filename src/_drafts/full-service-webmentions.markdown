title: "I Built a WebMention Service"
date: 2018-07-23
excerpt: |
  In my quest to make it the act of consuming and handling WebMentions more
  nifty as well as adding more options into the mix, I created a service that
  I'll maintain to help the community grow.

I mention on my site that it lightly supports [WebMentions][]. However, my
method for supporting WebMentions require me to constantly rebuild the site due
to compilation issues with the extension I use for Jekyll and fetching
WebMention[^1]

[^1]: This isn't to fault the author. If anything, it was opportunity.
[WebMentions]: /faq/indieweb/
