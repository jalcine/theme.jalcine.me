I've been using [ownCloud][] to handle my contacts and calendars recently in
(very high) hopes of moving away from using Google for all of my calendar and
contact purposes. So far, it's been working out pretty well. I have quite a
few applications installed on my instance handling files and RSS as well. The
nifty thing is that it has a Android client for file synchronization so I can
take a picture or video on my phone and it syncs over to ownCloud and gets on
my laptop as well, very similar to Dropbox's sync[^1]. When it comes to the
calendar application, it looks like exceptions to dates don't reflect well on
the Web interface despite it looking fine on my laptop when I use KOrganizer.
With the tasks application for ownCloud, I can finally move away from Wunderlist
and get to working on things locally. There isn't a default task application for
ownCloud but there's [Mirakel][1] which aims to handle tasks once they've
hammered out the issues with a CalDav extension on Android.

All in all, it's been quite enjoyable. The default theme is beginning to become
a bit of an eyesore though, so I think I might work on making a new one (I don't
see many themes for ownCloud to begin with so it might be worth looking to).
