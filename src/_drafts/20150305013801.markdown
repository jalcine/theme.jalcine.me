Setting up a VPN server is one hell of a job. I really thought it'd be easy to
just set up and go. Setting up a static key VPN using **[OpenVPN][]** [is really
straightforward][1] but we don't use static keys out here. It's a good start
though, in terms of familiarizing yourself with how OpenVPN works and all but
holy balls, lol. I remember seeing a tool that created a VPN automatically for
you using your own DigitalOcean[^1] account to handle making the VPS. For
$5/month, your own controlled VPN sounds really good. But as always, I was
curious how I could incorporate this VPN building into [oa][]. OpenVPN can use
TLS for its encryption since I figured since I managed to get the blog using
TLS, why not have the VPN do the same?[^2].

## Getting Things Going

[^1]: I think this was extended to Linode as well.
