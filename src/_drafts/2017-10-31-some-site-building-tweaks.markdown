  I'm gearing up to use my website more often as a communication channel.
  In doing so, some cleaning up of the house had to be done.

I've been using Jekyll for [some time now][1]. It's been really great since
I enjoy tooling and tweaking things to my heart's content. However, since making
the shift into (more-or-less) [full-time freelancing][2], I noticed that the
build flow for my site wasn't the easiest to work with.

As I begun looking at some pain points in the flow of tweaking my site, I took
some notes from [Michael][3]'s review of their Jekyll usage in [2016][4]
 and in [2017][4].
