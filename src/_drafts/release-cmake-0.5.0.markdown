I'm glad to announce that version `0.5.0` of my plugin for Vim,
[`cmake.vim`][cmakevim] has been released! It's a heavily tested, gut-torn-out
rewrite of the plugin and is ready for the public to use. The goal of this
plugin was for complete integration of the [CMake][] build configuration tool
within Vim and accompanying plugins like [YouCompleteMe][], [Syntastic][] and
make use of the features that other programs like [ctags][] had to offer
without too much heavy wiring into Vim. It _should_ be an plug-and-play
solution. Fortunately, if it's not, feel free to [report your issue][bugs] and
get it cracking.
