  I'm hashing out some thoughts (publicly) about what to do with my website.

I've used [Jekyll][] as my blogging engine for some time now. It's an efficient
solution if you're working on getting some static pages out onto the Web. GitHub
and GitLab make it _super_ easy to get a site going with it too. But now, with
my want to move more in tune with the tenants of the IndieWeb, I feel like using
it the way I am _now_ isn't going to help me _expand_. Thus, my current dilemma.

## The Objective

I want my site to be something that allows me to do the following:

  * hold my blog posts
  * handle comment rendering
  * load and publish [WebMentions][]
  * serve my other kinds of posts like:
    * check-ins
    * photo posts
    * pages I've read

The list goes on. Some of y'all might think this is that over sharing jazz. Eh.
It might be. But it's on my terms versus me submitting it to stuff like a bunch
of companies who need to have shit _hit the fan_, slide down the stem and brew
on the floor before they take action, if any.
