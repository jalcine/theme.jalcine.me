If there's one thing that makes a user of the console a good one; it's knowing
it well enough to navigate through it as if it were an extension of
themselves. If you're spending a good portion of your day in there, you should
able to do things like grabbing code, handling patches, managing your
multiplexer and more easily from the CLI. This is mainly about how I've set up
my system so my current use. A not-so-short GIF of me using my shell is
provided below.

**TODO: Add GIF here**.

# Shell
I use GNU Bash, the kind of Bash you'd get when shipping with a particular
Linux. I haven't made the attempt to try another shell out of the time capital
it'd require but a few compelling features in shells like `fish` and `zsh`
pique my curiousity enough to give them another look; definitely worth a
follow up post.
