excerpt: |
  I've used Jekyll for quite some time now. However, my objectives and goals to
  move my site to be more IndieWeb-adjacent is making me reconsider using this
  particular static site generator.

I like using the Web. A lot. Like despite my stances on data privacy, I give
chunks of it away to companies in return for pretty graphs and a sense of
"progress". Now that I've begun to understand _how_ more of this information can
be pulled back in house and kept under my control, I debate if I should consider
removing myself from the world of consumer-to-business dependency cycling and
look for other venues. I say all of this to mention that, this journey is going
to require me to re purpose my existing site here at https://jacky.wtf/.
