I first met Jonathon a while ago. And when I say a while ago, it was _some_
time. I remember when I (failed to) tried to get into [Blavity][] at the ground
floor. It was a video chat I had squirreled away in one of the offices at
Shutterstock with [Morgan][1] about potential opportunities. Granted now, I also
wonder and reflect on what _could_ have been.

We obviously both grew in very beautiful lanes, so no need to reflect anymore.

Jonathon wrote a piece about the things [he's learned from 2017 on Blavity][2].
If you haven't, you should catch up on his [2015][3] and [2016][4] posts as
well. Let's walk through some of the highlights of this post.

## Fake Friends

> **Access is earned**. It can be rescinded and/or denied as necessary.
> &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

This is something that rings home. A lot of people pop out of the wood work when
your name appears in the top results in Google's search results. Or if you
happen to trend in an area. Or even if your name's mentioned ample times in an
environment[^1]. You know my name? Cool. You _might_ [know who I am][5]. But if
I ain't confirm that we're friends and not just acquaintances, then chill with
the name dropping.

> Community is not about your convenience. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Son. Hold on. Let us _examine_ the opening sentence here.

_2017 saw a rise in people obfuscating the word *community* so much that it
started to sound like a synonym for a *membership* site you pay into instead of
a vibrant entity that is the sum total of its inputs, both seen and unseen._

If this isn't a word, then :shit: you might as well skip out on the rest of this
entry.

> Waiting until you clear your first million before you give isnâ€™t thoughtful.
> &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Reading this made me think of my immediate and then extended family. Jonathon
and I share the first-gen Caribbean descent aspect. I'm not sure about the
academic routes of his life (with regards to first accolades in academia) but
I know that my family _needed_ someone to pull in :money_with_wings: after
things got more difficult. That instilled in the behavior of sharing whatever
_whenever_. Whenever I negotiate pay or open a [new contracting engagement][6],
I almost always think about how the money can help those closest to me. It tends
to find a way to them somehow.

> Recognizing someone as valuable and treating them as valuable should never
> be conflated. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Another self-explanatory and concise one.

## Love, Relationships and Courtship

> Love without specific action is ambiguity that feels nice. The price for that
> is too high. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

This is something to note as well. It's become a bit of a thing (if not already)
to date or engage in relationships with no true direction. This might be the
analytical part of myself but direction and a working compass are things I like
to bring into relationships (of any size). I'm all for knowing what the point of
things are - where your head's at and what you'd like to go.

Of course, if you need time to figure that out; it's cool. The question now is
if I'm obliged to wait for something that's intrinsically related to you. That
said, here are some other tweets that reached out to me:

> Do not keep score. &mdash; [**Jonathon Jackson**][jon]

Do not compare yourself to others who are NOT you. I can't repeat this enough.
I said something about this year last year :wink::
