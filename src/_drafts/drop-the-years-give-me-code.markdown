Software engineers, web developers, application architects, QA engineers, etc.

These are all people who are currently NOT being evaluated properly in my
opinion. A lot of companies still cling to this idea of having "4+ years
experience in a particular language, framework, etc" being the best way to weed
out candidates. I mean, if you're looking for someone to port legacy code from
2007 to something made in 2011, then maybe it's a sure-fire way. But it always
tends to leave out more practical, real world applications of said candidate.
That mentioned, I'm more of the person who'd look to companies
