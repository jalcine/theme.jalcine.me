I'm working on a personal project that makes uses of [Hapi][] for its API layer.
I've managed to go about in a mostly test-driven fashion and worked from the
bottom up (from data modelling up to the route definition). Whilst working on
the ability to test the response states of routes, I noticed the incapibility of
the [Chai][] plugin for HTTP testing, [`chai-http`][]. For completeness, here is
what I'm working with:

{% codeblock app/routes/pumpkin.js lang:javascript %}
{% endcodeblock %}
