  This is going to be the year when it happens. When I finally dump social media
  from large unethically-slant companies by default. I'm super excited.

I spent my New Years in Oakland with some family that's in town, a book and some
nice hot tea. Conventionally, I would have been out in the town partying but
I haven't felt fulfilled doing that last night. Instead, after a few pages in
[a book I've been churning through][1], I began listing out some goals I wanted
to knock out this quarter and for the rest of the year[^1]. It's a short one:

* Backup information from corporate [silos][2].
* Get [Koype][] to an operational MVP.
* Build import tool from silo to Koype.
* Build supporting tools around Koype.

So far, I'm pretty far along with Koype! The only thing that's probably stopping
me from sending it out into the wild would be theming. I'm looking for a decent
solution to implement that within [Elixir][] / [Phoenix][].

[^1]: Not really resolutions in the pop culture sense since rarely do people manage to accomplish and brands manipulate peoples' inability to do so to market to their weakness - which is unethical.
