I live on the West Coast as of the time of writing, Oakland, to be exact. I used
to live in Brooklyn, New York. If there's one thing the West _hates_ the East
for doing on Twitter, it's ruining broadcast television events before they
premiere on their side of the world. I never had to run into this when I lived
out in New York City, but since moving to the Bay, I'd had show after show
spoiled right before my tweet-monitoring eyes.

I know. This is _beyond_ a first-world problem. This is _peak_ "free time" kind
of problem. However, since my free time has since been reduced and I've used
Twitter more to collect information on current events; having media I intend to
savor myself ruined right there before my eyes got me frustrated.
