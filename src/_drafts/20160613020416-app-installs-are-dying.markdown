Reviewing [Recode's latest on app installs][1], I totally understand the author
would even bother to write this. What's the point of installing a new
mobile application to your phone if everything you need is _already there_? It's
funny how this is pushed _so much_, the idea of the "end of the app" and the
"rise of chat applications" and yet we continue to spend so much time invested
in fueling platforms that are non-intuitive to the traditional "app" model.

Until seeing the presentation of progressive web applications by Addy at Google
during Google I/O 2016, I was _against_ the idea that web applications could
*ever* compete with native applications.

Then a realignment of my personal ambitions for the Web and progressive web
applications really hit me :sparkles:. The Internet, accurately, HTTP, is the
most accessible form of interconnectivity that any device can provide granted
that it's equipped with a Web browser.
