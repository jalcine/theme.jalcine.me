Since the start of 2015, I was curious how I was planning on labeling myself
when introducing myself to people I'd meet over the next few days. It had to be
explicit yet short, direct yet quip-like and snazzy enough to stick in one's
mind. I came up with these:

  * "Wannabe cookie expert and developer-at-medium"
  * "You won't remember who I am" -- Twist on Stark's favorite line.
