**TL;DR**: _I can't work for any tech organization anymore_. I mentioned
this to a few people before but now I'm writing out about it.

This isn't in response to recent events; it's been an on-going thing.
_It_ is the micro-aggressions, the quiet snickers and assumptions about what
makes a Black guy tick. Mind you, in my head, I still see myself as a
really young guy. I graduated from high school like 3 years ago[^1] so
things like marriage and retirement aren't really conversations I care
to have. Conversations about my hair[^2]
