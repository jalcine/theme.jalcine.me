  Hey Ma! I finally did it! I took an idea I've been sitting on and made it into
  a reality. black.af is a software consultancy geared to provide you with top
  performing solutions.

After a solid set of days on vacation[^1], I can finally get cozy with
announcing that I've turned *black.af* into a consultancy. You can learn about
[what kind of stuff][3] I'd be open to and even [open up a consultation][4] for
any kind of work you'd be interested into. I'll be updating some of the
references on this site to redirect there so it's more consistent. I'm excited
to kick the tires on this after sitting on this idea and notation for about
a year now!

### Why black.af?
I've gotten a bit of slight push back on the name of the company. It's
a shortening of the phrase "_black as fuck_", a statement I hold to my chest as
well as a lot of people proud of the Black/Africana ancestry. The consultancy
will also hold a few products I've been working on for some times, namely
[twch.at][5].

### How do I get in touch?
There's a whole page to streamline the process at https://black.af/intake. Use
that to simplify the whole discussion and speed it up for the both of us!
I focus heavily on Web development around Vue and Elixir applications but do
check out the [tools][3] to see if we align.

### What else is going on?
As part of me [setting up PeerTube on my server][6], I've decided to double
down and get more frequent with my live coding videos. If there's something
I benefited from a lot in my career was the ability to just sit and pair with
another developer. This gave me a chance to see the insight that another
developer has into the process of crafting their features, tests and
documentation. I'll be currently doing it on my [Twitch channel][7] until
PeerTube supports live streaming itself.
