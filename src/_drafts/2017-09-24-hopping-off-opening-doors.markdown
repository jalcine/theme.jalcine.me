  A lot has happened in the last two weeks of life. I've entered funemployment,
  [Good For POC][1] is transitioning to being an open source platform and I'm
  launching a few more projects.

Quite a lot is notable to mention in this update. For starters, I'm no longer
with [Lyft][]. [Good For Poc][1] is now [open sourced][3] and will be a core
focus of mine these upcoming weeks. Also, a side project [I've softly alluded][4]
is going to be launching in the near future among other things. I write about
[this briefly][5] in my newsletter. You should [subscribe][].

After [some time][2], I've parted ways with Lyft. The reasons are complex and
the departure was bitter sweet but it was for the best. I learned a lot about
working on hockey-puck-growth like teams and was able to bring things that I've
learned into the environment. I speak more on the specifics of what I've done at
Lyft [on my resume][6]. In conjunction to engineering work and as a fierce
proponent for diversity and inclusion; I worked on Lyft's Black ERG as a co-lead
as well with as Uplyft Tech. These organizations gave me some really big ideas
on how more companies could approach diversity internally as well; things
that'll be carried onto the next spot. That place could be yours. [**Let me
know**][7].
