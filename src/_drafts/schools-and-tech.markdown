My sister and I walked a few blocks over to our elementary and junior high
school[^1] a few days ago. I had some business to take care of and I had to go back
to begin said work. Stepping into the building after graduating close to 8
years ago feels a bit weird. Some of these steps I've tripped over, read a book
on, ate a snack on, got reprimanded by my parents in front of my friends on,
etc. Memories of my childhood played back too quickly in my mind, and I could
tell my sister had the same moment when she asked me if I felt it too. I did.

# Reflecting Then

I remember in the 6th grade heading over to Mr. Hobbes' room for computer
class. That's what it was called, "Computer", very direct and to the point. I
don't even remember _exactly_ what we did; but I do remember having classes on
how to format documents using Microsoft Word. I explicitly remember having to
make a brochure _and_ a poster. Over time, more of the core classes required us
to have important assignments typed and printed. Of course, this probably led
to a heavy taxation on school resources since now there was a semi-predictable
drain of ink and available machines to work on[^2], but it was for a good cause.
Personally, for the last few months, I think the only time I use a pen and
paper to write is when I'm sketching ideas before I can verbally compose them
or when I'm signing off an archaic receipt for a debit card transaction.

Mrs. Wright, Mr. Hobbes and Mr. JeromÃ© were the three computer teachers that
I've had whilst in that school from the 4th grade up. I notice now that it
wasn't really about the students learning _about the_ computer but more-so
learning _of_ its uses and being aware of its existence. The first computer I
did end up using _was_ in school and probably was so until 2006 when my mother
and I came back from East New York with a hefty Compaq machine. That was
definitely one of the ten ten moments of my life[^3]. I really didn't know what
to do at it first so of course it resorted to classical gaming. Sites like
Millsberry and Miniclip were made home pages in Internet Explorer at one point
in time (a long one) and seemingly no one minded. Pounding away at the other
games we've collected from AOL discs didn't stop the siblings new-found
addiction to the DOS machine running in our living room. Soon, we became
the resident "experts" at the machine.

# Reflecting Now

I step into the office of the new head Dean of my junior high school and he
greets my sister and I very warmly as all of the teachers who remembered us
do[^4]. We had a chance to speak quickly on the reason of the visit and then
after glancing at my [hoodie][nyrn] went into current events and how they're
beginning to reflect the past he grew up in down South. This guy marched with
Sharpton and Jackson in their younger days so it's a history lesson I
enjoyed. But as was everything at that moment might have been, it was yet
another distraction.

I'm terrified at the thought that these kids are growing up not knowing how
much _power_ is stored inside their pockets and how their brilliant minds can
be used to power said devices and machines. To tell a young child that they can
literally build anything they want and to provide them with the hammer and nail
to do so is an act of mental liberation and empowerment. Of course, at such a
young age and without too much historical context on how things were twenty
years ago as opposed to today, all of it would be taken for granted[^5]. What
sucks though is that they won't learn that it was [a woman who built the first
compiler for a programming language][grace] or that [a dude crafted most of
what's BSD UNIX][bill] or even that [a brother wrote the most popular and widely
use shell on the planet][fox]. I learned all of this within 2014 and I **hate**
that. Why wasn't this placed front and center? I probably shouldn't be all that
mad since we still lie to children about how Europe first encountered the
Western hemisphere[^6] but it's a funky country, I'm entitled to my thoughts.

I want my sisters to continue their legacy of amazing work in the new medium
that we've been birthed into. I want my brothers to know that they can be
the painters, sculptors and inventors of today and tomorrow. I want my people
to be aware that for centuries, we've _brought_ the culture, knowledge and
passion that the world over have craved time and time again. I want us to
continue that in the new era that's coming (or is here, depending how you look
at it) and continue our legacy for bringing dope shit to the table. That starts
with how and what we teach our kids of the future. We can't have them using
six-year old textbooks when we can have books with information that can be
annotated by the teacher and updated in real time according to current events.
There's no reason why a math class can incorporate the use of visual cues to
make even the most complicated of topics more digestible. Even an art class can
take heavy advantage of exploring color theory at a young age with the aid of
technology.

Outside of the _confusing_ lack of funding of education (but seemingly infinite
in "defense"), there's a few ways to circumvent this. I have ideas but just
showing up and presenting the things that _can be made_ and _were made_ using
technology would be a first step. A lot of these guys now have Facebook and
Instagram[^7] so showing how each part of the application potentially works
would be a first step in getting them interested from a product design and
software development standpoint.

I just want to know when I'm 30, 40 years older that my brothers and sisters
are **makers** and not only consumers of the tools of tomorrow. That isn't too
much to ask at all; it's our calling.
