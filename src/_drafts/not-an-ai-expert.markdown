Over the last three years, Wintermute's taught me a lot about what I expected
to learn about artificial intelligence. The biggest takeaway is that it's one
of the biggest moving targets in computer science there is. From speech
synthesis to chess playing mastery, we constantly demote what would classify a
computer as intelligent and push the bar higher for something that'd be
recognized as an embodiment of artificial intelligence. That's a good and bad
thing. It's good because it's driving more and more researches, enthusiasts
and tinkerers into the field. It's bad because for those with less passion, it
can drive them away from the field altogether.

I was taking some time to review some four year old code. Most of it was
related to the earlier form of Wintermute[^1] that was supposed to take the
world by storm. It also included a potential Qt library that'd make it easier
to use PocketSphinx in Qt applications but at the time, I punted on it.
Reviewing that code made me realize how _little_ I actually knew I knew about
the field and how much further I had to go today. I don't see it as a mistake
or a misstep. I'm actually really glad I made all of these wild assumptions
about the world, that one could just load an file loaded with Web ontology
references, smack together a part-of-speech tagger and automatically have
binaries that could understand the English I rolled into it. To a point, it
worked. I managed to get the phrase "We are boys" correctly tagged using the
[grammar][1] and [node][2] rules over weeks of tweaking. But that was weeks of
unaided, mostly experimenting and tweaking of said rules and referencing to
books I had here on English grammar typically used for writing. That went only
so far before I kind of gave up and got a full-time job that prohibited me
from spending a lot of time on things like this.

[^1]: I was CRAZY. Like bat-shit crazy. I really thought I could build something on par with JARVIS at the time.
