  If this ends up being one of those corny “omg 2016” posts, I won’t fault
  you for not reading the rest of the my posts.

  I’m not sure why I wrote this post. It definitely came as a point of
  reckoning, me attempting to clear my mind a bit.

In 2016, I’ve met a lot of people with their own objectives, views,
identities and politics. A portion of these people are dead and are only
remembered via books, film and other forms of media. Others were met in person,
with a chance to strengthen bonds like none other. I learned (or was
reintroduced) to the fact that a lot of people, if not all, never can be as
genuinely open and intentional when they first meet people. I also began to
(re-)understand some cracks in my personality and its effects on the relationships
I’ve had over the years.

## Changing Places

I had *a lot* of fun at [Clef][]. Outside of the fact that we were coworkers and
a team, we are friends! I missed the last [Clef Cooks][] event due to
a small gathering in New York City for [Good for POC][] -- planning on making it
to the next one! I recently had a personal change of scenery - a lot more
sunlight (even my desk is naturally lit now) and I have more space to do things
I typically went out (and paid money :sick:) to do.

I read a _lot_. I try to keep progress in my [Goodreads][] account but that’s
becoming more and more arduous as the books go by. One book of note was Malcolm
X’s biography by Alex Haley. It’s been some time since I’ve read it. This is
a formal notice from me personally that this book cannot be used as a means of
saying `#NotAllWhitePeople`. The book _never_ says that about America. But
I digress.

I start work (for real this time, I just signed my offer [in the last post][1])
with [Lyft][] on January 2, 2017. I’ll be sure to seriously keep you in tune
with the things I learn[^1] at my time at Lyft. One thing that I also did like
is hearing about peoples’ times at companies and understanding how growth and
the ilk worked there. Lyft already has a lot of information around
this - couldn’t hurt to give my view as an incoming engineer.

All of this is to say, 2016 was a rough year in some parts and a blessing in
others. 2017, outside of stuff happening after the 22nd of January, is going to
be one hell of a year.
