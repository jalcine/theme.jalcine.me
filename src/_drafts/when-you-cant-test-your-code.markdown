Let's say you're working on software. You work on it for about a month or so
and it's not really done but it's on its way there. Now, with being a good
developer, you want to employ "best practices". One of them tend to be testing
your code as or after you write code (most preferably before, though). Some
things to note is that:

  + You didn't write this application with testing in mind. And you shouldn't
    write code with testing in mind; it'd grow to be run in a test suite than
    rather in a production environment.

  + You don't want to litter your code with testing add-ons and do-dahs.

  + It isn't a web application.

That's probably the tipping point (the third point).
