I don't usually talk about heavy politics, especially self-reflecting critiques
on my site. First time for everything. I'll start this off by saying that the
_obsession_ the Black community in the United States has with money is a sick
poison that's going to allow us to live and kill us at the same time. Yes,
I work in a industry and in a role that almost insures me a six-figure
salary[^1]. I also have a hereditary debt[^2]. It's a space in the software
industry[^3]

[^1]: When I started out, I was making just $25,000 shy of $100,000.
[^2]: As the son of immigrants and the oldest, I pay out a lot for my family.
[^3]: This is what <abbrev title="Mainstream Media">MSM</abbrev> call "tech". :confused:
