  A non conclusive, mild-informed but open look at how social media, its users
  and activism are coming together.

The foundation of the insanely huge system that allows you to read what I've
punched into my laptop here was established in the early 70s. It took some time
for us to figure out not only can we send money and information over this
meta-network but emotion, compassion and plain old ignorance[^1]. The
Internet's a tool for some and a portal for many, but it's hyper-relative to
the one who's making use of it.

My generation[^2] has taken this Internet and made it into a creature like none
other. Creatures, if you may, because most of us don't realize how
compartmentalized yet fluid of a system it is. I think the best comparsion of a
physical entity to the Internet would be our oceans. Some governments own
_huge_ chunks of IP space (think of that as the Indian ocean) and others we
share (like the Pacific, for the most, on a really, really good day).

Thanks to people like [Jack Dorsey][jack], we have [a place we can speak our
mind and have people, like-minded or not, read our 140 character thoughts][twtr].

[^1]: Fun fact, a year after Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, the Internet in the form of ARPANET came to be.
[^2]: I'm claiming my "generation" to be from 1989 to 1999, birth-wise.
