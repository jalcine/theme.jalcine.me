It was the night of the BET 2015 Awards ceremony. I wasn't really paying
attention to it; thanks to the ever-present live streaming of events on Twitter.
A friend of mine shared a GIF that was made of a collage of selfies that she
liked. In order for me to open it up, I had to view it on Google Photos in my
Web browser on my laptop. I admired it and then continued to the landing page
of [Google Photos][1] to check out the photos I have uploaded to Google. At the
time, it was quite some time since I've visited the Web interface and since the
[new features announced at Google I/O][2], I was curious. The page's partitioned
into a few spaces, as once might see, pictures of faces Google's recognized
throughout your collection; family, friends, former partners, the whole
stretch. Underneath that, the location specific partition showed the general
location of where photos were taken (for me, New York). Then I saw it.

The speed at which I screenshotted and then tweeted this represented the
momentary anger I had.
