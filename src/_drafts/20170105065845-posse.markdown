I made a post on Goodreads about wanting to take a lot of my content in house
and tend share it outwards to these social networks in lieu of making myself
that authoritative source of reference when it comes to me. I’m not a celebrity in
any form nor do I fully trust any service that I don’t directly work on to
remain completely in the favor of its users (or in more cases, its products).
