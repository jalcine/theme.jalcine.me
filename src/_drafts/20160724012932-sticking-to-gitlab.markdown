I used to host a copy of all of my projects at my personal Git tree on my
"private cloud"[^1]. Right now, I'm working on picking a new service
(self-hosted or not) to hold this code. After a bit of homework, I think Gitlab
_might_ be my best bet.

## I Don't Need Everyone in My Code
Most of this that I plan to work on is mainly projects I don't _want_ to open
source but will have no problem extracting aspects of them for the sake of open
sourcing. I also need to ensure a level of control.
