This post is a quick and hasty one. Yesterday evening, my partner and a friend
attended the protest that took place at Downtown Oakland. It went as far as the
exit held by Jackson and 5th St and was done by a thousand people. It's been
close to two years since I've participated in a on-foot, road congesting protest
for Black lives and it felt good to be amongst people who shared similar values.

At least I figured so. There was a tremendous amount of nearly-triggering
comments made by allies[^1] that threw me off. It kept me aware that provided
something _really_ went south, they'd most likely swing tail and run. It wasn't
a lot of people, mind you, just a lot of repeated, well, bullshit.

There was an older Black man who took the microphone who said something that I
found to be very direct but it took me a few moments that it wasn't directed for
anyone who wasn't of Oakland and yet still hasn't done any _actual_ work (more
on this later). The gist of the statement was that being here means nothing if you don't
take _anything_ away from it and apply it to the community. Action isn't only 
here, it's a constant flow of work that's been applied to heal and undo the
damage done.

That stuck with me.
