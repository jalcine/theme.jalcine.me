title: "Let's Get Over Github"
---

[Github][]. The infamous spot for hosting code. It schooled [Sourceforge][],
[Launchpad][] (to an extent), and now [Google Code][] decided to let them
[handle the code-hosting jazz][1][^1]. It's what every startup company would
want, to come into a game _after_ its competitors and have them bend to their
will; essentially becoming the _market_. People've built products around Github
like [Waffle.io][] and [Gitter.im][]. But we get it. One-click repository
creation! Per-repository Wikis! Web hooks based on the Git hooks! Amazeballs!

But now it's gotten a bit ridiculous to be honest. There's people who I can't
name who'd go as far as to deem you an incapable programmer if you lack a Github
account or don't use Git. I feel like that's a loaded statement (and a judge of
individual character), but it points to a bigger problem. We rely _too_ much on
this service. Anyone can say the same of Google, but they've had a habit of
cutting things when we get close to them, to make us stronger[^2].

Now before you'd think I'm going all kami-Github-kaze and just nuking my Github
from LEO (low Earth orbit), hear me out. There's nothing really _immediately_
wrong with Github. I'm just concerned about dependency, more so my personal
dependency on the service. That's why I've set up <http://git.jacky.wtf>[^3].
I really think of it as my place to stash shit when I don't need it to be on my
"public" facing Github account; which leads me into another point.

## Github Essentially Became Your Clothes

People have written on how Github became (to some) a resume for developers. If
there's no activity on your Github account, one would assume that you don't
code, or at the most, don't contribute to any other openly available projects
and produce your own. This is a **whole another** topic on the ease of access
(and acceptance) of newcomers to getting their feet wet to open source
contributing that overly entitled (seemingly not apparent to themselves) people
run into. I can say it's wrong and it's a crooked way to look at this, but
that's the way things are (for now).
