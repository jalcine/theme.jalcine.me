Firstly, I have to apologize to the users of `cmake.vim` who received
near-terrible performance with version 0.3.x. I was struggling to understand
how I could parse CMake information without slowing down Vim too much; but that
proved to be just a Vim problem. I'm steadfast on making this a Vimscript-only
plugin so that it's relatively cross-platform.
