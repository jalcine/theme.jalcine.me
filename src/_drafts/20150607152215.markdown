Since leaving Shutterstock, I've worked as a freelancer but still actively
looked for work as a full-stack web developer until late April. I've gone into
the interview process with a few companies as far as final interviews and
meeting teams with some companies[^1] and gotten pretty decent accolades
regarding my background and skill-set, all of which I'm disregarding now.
I think it's once a throughout glance at my online persona or maybe even
my [About page][about] gives an indicator (typically wrong) of what I'm
about. It's not even being "woke" or "conscious"; it's about having the
balls to head over to HR _thinking_ that you can get a compliant about
racial complications because of an inappropriate racial remark someone
might have had. The thing is, as a Black male, what are the chances that
people will take you seriously when it comes to mentioning that references
to my usual attire reminds them of a __demonic character from a video game
I've never played__, specifically the kind of jewelry I was wearing?

I find the lack of on-site training for just interacting with people outside
of your culture comforting and disconcerting at the same time[^2]

[^1]: At the time of writing, I'm debating whether or not should I name them.
[^2]: This, equivocally, is feeling "some type of way".
