  This is a condensed narrative about my daily life in my home neighborhood.
  The point of this was to exemplify how the change for the neighborhood has
  been bad in more ways than `Infinity`, but did leave a string of niceities 
  that improved the area. Barclay Center was NOT one of these things.

I've lived in Brooklyn *all* my life. Like I was born in a hospital that's
named after its county, I've gone to a high school named after the borough and
I've worked at a museum named after it as well as a college. I want to say I'm
as Brooklyn as Spike Lee, but that's pushing it. I remember all of grade
school, it being less than five minutes of a walk away, and everyone lived in
the area. Growing up there though, didn't prepare me for racial awareness and
inclusion. I mean, we knew that Indian[^1] families ran the corner stores[^2],
Chinese[^3] people ran the Chinese food spots and Blacks held down the food
spots. Oh yeah, the Jewish guys in our area held down most of the urban-esque
Macy's (dare I say!)[^4] outlets. They were more like general-purpose stores,
having products ranging from notebooks to television sets, bicycles and
even furniture. With such a blustering area when compounded with a
varying selection of produce stores, a local library and a park;
you couldn't see a need to leave the area.

In 2008, I've begun to notice a bit of construction in the area. I think that
Mazon was finished setting up its new location closer to my then-former junior
high school. It was on the corner of Lincoln Place and Nostrand Avenue where
this happened. It was the old Jamaican/Grenadian spot that served some of
_the best_ jerk chicken I had ever tasted! I spent so much of the money my
parents gave me at that place, to a point where they knew me by my first name.
I didn't ask how it got closed down, but it did strike a chord with me at the
time. I was too comfortable with constantly visiting the area; a part of my
ritual was just extracted with consent or real warning. In its place, stands
the first (that I saw) coffee shop within that strip of Nostrand Avenue[^6]. At
first, in 2011, I thought it was cool, having a coffee shop in the area. I
didn't care too much for coffee[^7], but their muffins were decent enough for
me to buy them once in a while.

A few weeks prior to this (or after, they don't really alert the community when
they change their environment), I remember seeing a Dunkin Donuts chain on the
Flatbush-heading side of Nostrand and Eastern Parkway. This didn't upset me too
much either, since donuts are cool and Dunkin sells loads of them. It did end
up becoming the floating grounds of those disenfranchised in the area so that
reduced my chances of purchasing goods from them[^8].

[^1]: That's what we all assumed. It's not like we asked, they went with it, too.
[^2]: I've found it hard to refer to bodegas or delicatessens as anything else but a corner store.
[^3]: Turns out a lot of the ones that are in neighborhood say Chinese but are run by Vietnamese people!
[^4]: **TODO**: Add a picture here.
[^5]: If memory serves me right, it happened over a weekend.
[^6]: From Eastern Parkway down to about Pacific St.
[^7]: Being raised in a Caribbean, specifically Haitian, household, tea lives where coffee stands in America's hearts.
[^8]: There's a McDonalds on Fulton St that's notorious of having this complication.
