The last few weeks have been hectic but amazing. With a deeper understanding,
one would say that the current alignment of the planets are definitely at play
here. But also juggling a grasp of astrophysics, we're also subject to the laws
of whatever has the greatest gravitational tug at the moment[^1]. Work has been
really good over the last few weeks, I'm learning a lot. I've also begun a bit
of a process by enrolling in academia once more - you might have subtly seen
the addition of the education background on LinkedIn.

## Why Are You Going to School?
That's something I plan to expand on after graduation. For now, just hold to the
time at which I made this choice and the place at which I chose to go. It won't
be in the realm of computer science - I'm confident that everything I need to
know I can learn on the go and anything else is already in a MOOC somewhere.

[^1]: I think that's Saturn right now.
