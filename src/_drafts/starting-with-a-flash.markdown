It was a very interesting interviewing cycle for me. I went through three
other companies before this happened; but starting the 21st of April, I'll be
a software engineer at the ever-fabulous [Shutterstock][]! It's a very big
change of scenery for me since I've been nose-deep in Ruby and C++ work. At
Shutterstock, I'd be using these languages and more to help build the best
technology there is when it comes to selling royalty-free images.

I'll probably document my time and what I learn there every two weeks or so.
