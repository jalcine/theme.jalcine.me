I love side projects! They give me a chance to work on projects that I don't 
normally get to work on when working. This one is a bit of a dozy. ActivityDesk
aims to be a simple and fast[^1] client for desktops to work with ActivityPub
accounts. Conventionally you'd work in a server-to-server (S2S) approach
