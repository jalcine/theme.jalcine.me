I've been really pushing to get my platform (which is _practically_ there)
to be more [IndieWeb][] adjacent. With every ambition, one needs to set
a few goals. This post will serve as a way for me to measure and set those
goals!

## Make WebMentions "Native"

Currently, my [statically generated site][1] supports both [traditional
comments][2] and kind of supports [WebMentions][3]. WebMention logic looks
a bit like this:

![How WebMentions look.]({% asset posts/webmention-classic.png @path %})

Now, that same set of WebMentions look like this:

[indieweb]: https://indieweb.org/
[1]: {{ site.url }}/faq/about-website/
[2]: {{ site.url }}{% post_url 2018-04-07-comments-are-back %}
[3]: {{ site.url }}{% post_url 2018-05-09-getting-more-indie %}
