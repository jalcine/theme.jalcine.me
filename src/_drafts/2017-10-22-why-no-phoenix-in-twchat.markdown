When I started working on twch.at, I wanted to make sure that everything I did
was for the sake of learning and providing value. I initially wrote the API for
twch.at using Hapi, a solid JavaScript framework for writing server side
applications. After a bit of thought, I realized that I wasn't trying anything
too experiment-worthy in the language at the time (close to a year ago at the
time of writing). Frankly, this might be me taking the whole "do things that
don't scale" a bit too seriously because I deleted working code. A lot of
working code.

## Why?

twch.at will provide me value _personally_ and I know of friends who are mad
that I haven't launched soon.
