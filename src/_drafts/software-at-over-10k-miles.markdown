* Space is an issue, good move on buying 14" laptop.
* If no power is provided, ensure all devices are fully charged prior to departure.
* Books are required, at least two, in the (likely) event you run out of power.
* If you're planning to code that requires dependencies from the Internet,
  either:
    - pay for that Internet.
    - prebuild everything over phone's network prior to departure.
* Avoid working on changes to hardware that would induce high level changes.
