I think so. Just to be sure, check out my [contracting][1] page and see
if we are in tune.

## Projects That'd Take Priority
There's a few genre of projects that (on my discretion), I'd take a priority
into working on due to their impact. They tend to revolve around one or more of
the following:

  - Social good
  - Economic empowerment for those systematically disenfranchised
  - Community engagement
  - Youth education
  - Decolonized historical introductions to events
