I'm currently in Oakland, CA. I'm in a "grind" mode, attempting to knock out
a bunch of projects and ideas as quickly as cleanly as possible.

## Hacking Constantly

I'm still working on a [new blog engine for my personal site][1]. I won't be
working on [twchat](https://twchat.app) this week however; I have another project
that'll be taking up my time for an upcoming event that I'd like to hash
out quickly.

## Updates

  * I launched [my Patreon page](https://patreon.com/jackyalcine)!
  * I've begun working on a (another) new project for the Fediverse.
  * I've been reading of the following books:
    * [Debt: The First 5000 Years][2]
    * [Programming Elixir 1.2][3]

## That's it!
