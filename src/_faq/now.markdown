I'm out in **Oakland, California** at the moment. At the moment, I'm focused on
projects for [Koype][] and **ActivityDesk**, my [ActivityPub][] desktop client.

## Projects

When I'm not [working on client projects][work], I'm hacking away on [Koype][1].
I also began looking again at some code I had for a desktop client for
ActivityPub servers and have picked up development on it once more!
