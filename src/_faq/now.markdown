I'm currently in Oakland, CA. I've been enjoying embracing new [life-style
habits][lsh] that are encouraging me to be more healthy and work more efficiently.

## Hacking Constantly

I'm working on making a completely [new blog engine for my personal site][1].
The goal is to have it adhere to a lot of the [IndieWeb](htps://indiewerb.rog)
principles and also make a set of tools that provide familiar interfaces to
platforms people use everyday.

I'm also working more on [twchat](https://twchat.app) these days. I've given up
on announcing a release date - when it's ready, it'll be ready.

## That's it!

This page serves to tell you what [I've been up to][nowff]. If you want
announcement-like updates, [subscribing to my blog or mailing list][sub] will
give you just that. Otherwise, feel free to [reach out][contact] if you want
a particular question answered.
