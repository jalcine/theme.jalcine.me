I'm out in **Oakland, California** at the moment. I'm attending a bunch of events
around the conference [AfroTech 2018][5]. I'm aiming to have some recap posts
about what I learned, who I ran into and what occurred at [Blavity][]'s third
annual conference.

## Projects

Outside of _work_ [work][], I'm picking up development again on [Koype][1] and
aiming to have something more presentational. Namely getting the main project
website for Koype up and going with something light and simple as well as
getting some Heroku deploy links going as well. I'd set up instructions for
Dokku more likely since that's how I [host all of my personal software][blog:1].

## Books

This week, I'm reading the following:

* [Debt: The First 5,000 Years][book:1] by [David Graeber][author:1]
* [The Gifts of Imperfection][book:2] by [Bren√® Brown][author:2]

## Photo

I also have a new picture of my face for y'all:
