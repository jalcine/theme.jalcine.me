I'm out in **Oakland, California** at the moment. I'm working on a suite of
projects targeted the open source Web. [I've written about them at length on
my blog][1]{: .u-mention-of .u-reply-to}

## Projects

When I'm not [working on client projects][work], I'm hacking away on [Koype][1].
I also began looking again at some code I had for a desktop client for
ActivityPub servers and have picked up development on it once more!

## New Posts

I've written some new content on my blog.
