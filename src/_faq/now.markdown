I'm out in **Oakland, California** for the holidays. Currently, I'm off from
work so I'm spending all of my time working on [Koype][]; mainly improving its
test suite so it'll be safe / friendly to new contributors.

## Projects

**ActivityDesk** is still in the experimental design phases but the logic for
the project is underway. WebFinger support is there, basic parsing of JSON-LD is
in there but I haven't done any strict checking. Going to punt that for
a while before getting deeper into it.

## Books

Currently, I'm reading the following books:

  * [Refactoring UI][1]
  * [Sistah Vegan: Food, Identity, Health & Society: Black Female Vegans Speak][2]
