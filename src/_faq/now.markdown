I'm currently in Oakland, CA. I'm still hacking on projects I hold close. It
being one of the more hectic quarters of the year, I'm bracing for impact.

## Open Projects I'm Working On

The flagship open project I'm working on is still going to be [Koype][1]
However, I am looking to re-implement some projects I started for the
[IndieWeb][], namely the [IndieMark Scanner][4].

## Updates

  * I'm finishing up some touches for an application that'd go live sometime
    this week.
  * I've still reading of the following books:
    * [Debt: The First 5000 Years][2]
    * [Programming Elixir 1.2][3]
  * I wrote a post about [the self hosted services I run][blog:1]

## That's it!
