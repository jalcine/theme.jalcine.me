I'm currently in Oakland, CA. I've been enjoying embracing new [life-style
habits][1] that are encouraging me to be more healthy and work more efficiently.

## Hacking Constantly

I've rebuilt [my personal infrastructure][1], [adding some tracking][2] and
[reintroduced comments][3].

I got a few new projects in the pipeline. I'm working on re-vamping the
[projects page][4] to give more detail into that - I'll be telling my
[subscribers][sub] about it first.

## That's it!

This page serves to tell you what [I've been up to][nowff]. If you want
announcement-like updates, [subscribing to my blog or mailing list][sub] will
give you just that. Otherwise, feel free to [reach out][contact] if you want
a particular question answered.
