I recently left [Brooklyn, New York City][bk] and I'm heading back to [Oakland,
California][oak] where I live. I'm so excited for the [Black Panther][bp] movie
that's coming out soon as well as Infinity Wars. I'm working on a few things
at the moment:

## Next Digital Writing

> **[Subscribe today][sub]** if you haven't already.

I'm working on some thoughts for blog posts about traveling lighter and lighter
as I fly more frequently. Also looking into more methods for handling hostile
networks as I tend to use open networks via a SSH-based VPN.

## Side Project Development

I'm working on putting some final touches on the front-end experience of
[twch.at][]. I'm also working on a re-write of [Good for PoC][]'s API to make it
more friendly to new contributors and for me to maintain.

Managing two full projects that span three languages (Ruby, Elixir and
JavaScript) is a bit of a headache. It's good that at [Lob][] I work on a lot of
JavaScript so the context switch isn't tremendous.
