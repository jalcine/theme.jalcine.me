I used a few services and tools.

* [DigitalOcean][] for hosting.
* [DNSimple][] for my domain name.
* [Jekyll][] for building the site.
* [GitHub][] to host the [source code of my site][src].
* [Neovim][] to edit the sources with my [settings][vimrc].
* All of these [Ruby gems][gems] and [Node packages][pkg].
