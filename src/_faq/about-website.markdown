I have a [custom server setup][3] for hosting this website. Below that, I use
a few tools. Things like [DigitalOcean][] handle the virtual private server that
I use for this and my [analytics][1] system. [Jekyll][] handles the act of
converting my flat life website into the one you see here. Domain name
management is done via [DNSimple][]. I store the latest copies of the source
code of my site on [my personal Git server][2].
