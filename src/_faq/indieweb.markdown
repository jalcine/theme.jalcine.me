The [IndieWeb][] is a noble mission to give patrons of the Internet more
autonomy over the data they produce and the sites that can make use of it. I can
go on and on but they've written up a lot about [why][1].

## WebMentions

[WebMentions][] are a [W3C approved specification][2] on how Web sites should
handle the act of mentioning (by URI or link) the presence of another site. From
the spec's abstract:

> Webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site.
> From the receiver's perspective, it's a way to request notifications when
> other sites mention it.

It's a powerful way to counteract things like spam, allows people to own their
responses and much more. This site supports it.
