title: Who are you on Mastodon?

On 2018-05-04, the TLS certificate for <https://mastodon.xyz>, an instance of
[Mastodon][] that I used the most expired. That effectively blocked me from
using it on my phone and computer. I had to hop over to [Are0h's][1] instance
over on [Play Vicious][2]. At the time of writing, I'm going to be working off
the Play Vicious account. But I do frequent on other places. Below are 
profiles of myself elsewhere.

  * [`@jalcine@playvicious.social`][a1]: Primary
  * [`@jackyalcine@mastodon.xyz`][a2]

I'm working on pulling off reliance on others for this and keeping it on my own
systems. Stay tuned.
