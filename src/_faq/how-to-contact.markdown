There's a few things that tend to land in my inbox a lot. To help future
submissions get higher response rates, I've provided this page.

## Scheduling Time
> When it comes to scheduling time, ["Coffee" by @cattsmall][1] is an excellent
> reference point.

For ease of management, I use [Calendly][3] to handle calendar appointments
and/or window of times at which people wish to reach out. Feel free to book time
with me for [15 minutes][4] or [30 minutes][5].

### Location Matters
My general availability is tight - I juggle a lot during the day (and night).
Eagerness to meet in San Francisco during the weekdays or in Oakland over the
weekend heightens the chances of the meeting happening sooner than later.

### Brief Me
The more about what you want that you tell me in advance, the more useful I can
be to you. The objective is to reach a point of mutual prosperity. Help me help
you.
If you think that your question might be generic or out there, there's a chance
that I've answered it in my [FAQ](/faq). Check it out if you haven't yet.

## Press Request
Information about myself and press details are available, without having to
reach me, at my [Press][2] page. Anything in deeper detail should be sent using
my [contact form][3].
