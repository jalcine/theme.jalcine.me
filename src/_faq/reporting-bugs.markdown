If you ever see some kind of content that's been created by a third party on
here and looks malicious - feel free to [contact me][1].

On the off chance (more likely :wink:) that there's a visual bug or you want to
provide some context into site fixes, I recommend also [contacting me][1] but
also sending any screenshots and files to my federated file storage service. My
ID for that is `arno@noctule.jacky.wtf`.

[1]: /contact/
