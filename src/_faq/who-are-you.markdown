A question I meditate on and try to come to an answer comfortably. I provide
a few different answers here.

## Career-wise

I'm a [software engineer][2] by trade. It's a [hobby-turned-skill][1] of mine
and it's something I'm extremely passionate about.

## Broadly

I wrote (scruffily) about how I got into [programming][1]. Granted, that's not
_who_ I am. That tells you about _one_ of the things I do. I don't know that for
certain just yet, but I am aware of things I am good at that seems to align to
a purpose.
