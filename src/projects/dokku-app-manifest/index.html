    An attempt to make the act of deploying a bunch of applications that Dokku
    can support a lot more simpler and programmatic. We have tools like
    Terraform for building servers, Ansible to handle provisioning of said
    servers but this aims to make it simple to deploy a set of application to
    a machine as defined by the manifest.
